# Uploading Scenarios

We recommend pressing `Upload Changes` often to ensure your work is not lost.

This will allow you to view it in Infinite Flight's Flight Training page **after restarting the app**.

This will upload a scenario as a draft.

#### Publishing Scenarios to the Public

This currently has to be done manually by Infinite Flight staff. Please contact Cameron to facilitate this.
