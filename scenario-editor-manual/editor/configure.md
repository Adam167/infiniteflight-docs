# Configure Scenario

You can set the name, description and thumbnail here. These are currently shown on the Flight School page of Infinite Flight.

## Aircraft and Livery

**These are required or else the rest of the scenario can't be configured.** This is because states are specific to aircraft.

This will determine the aircraft and livery that is available when the user first starts the app. 

Note
: If the aircraft is only available behind a Pro subscription, the Scenario will only be available to Pro subscribers.

## Start Information

**This is required.**

You must upload a State File, which contains the information required to position an aircraft within Infinite Flight ready to begin the scenario. Here is how to do this:

Step 1

: Start your flight in Infinite Flight and configure the aircraft (attitude, speed, autopilot, NAV, etc.)

Step 2

: Go to the Systems menu and tap `Save`

Step 3

: Transfer the .pbf file you saved to the device you are running the Scenario Editor on

Step 4

: Upload the State File. You can validate if it is correct by the information shown in the Editor.

Step 5

: `Upload Changes` in the top right to save it and include it as part of your scenario.

## Settings

 - **End Flight on Scenario Complete**: Leave this checked if you want the flight to end once the final completion condition has been met. Otherwise, the user is free to continue flying until they end the session manually.
