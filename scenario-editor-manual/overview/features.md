# Editor Features

These are some of the advanced features of the Scenario Editor that are worth being aware of.

## Translations

The Scenario Editor supports content in all of the languages that Infinite Flight supports. An English string is currently required for any text input, but you can press the "Translate" button next to the "Edit" button to open a language editor.

**Languages are optional, but English is currently required.**

#### Translate with AI

Infinite Flight is offering an experimental **Translate with AI** option. Simply enter the text in English, and we will use GPT3.5 to attempt to translate the sentences using authentic technical terms and language-specific idioms. We welcome any feedback on this.

## Text to Speech Audio

We automatically generate Text to Speech audio for each step whenever you upload a Scenario for each language using Azure's Text to Speech engine. We welcome any feedback on this.
