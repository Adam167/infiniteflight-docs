# Welcome to the Scenery Editor Manual!



## Guide Version: 21.8.0



Welcome to the Scenery Editor Manual, designed to help newly qualified and veteran editors alike, bring 2D and 3D airport updates to Infinite Flight. 



There are currently three types of editing, Editors **must**{.red} ensure they fall within one of these categories when editing *(see [1A.3.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/1a.-administration/1a.3-editor-rules#1a.3.2) below)*:

- A 2D* only edit of a non-3D airport
- A 2D edit of a current 3D airport (with the requirement to change the 3D elements if affected by the 2D changes)
- A 2D and 3D edit of a non-3D Airport



**2D editing is defined as: visual fixes to lines, aprons, runways and taxiways. The creation of a taxi network or the naming and connecting of taxiways. Updating and checking airport date including, but not limited to, names, ICAO codes and frequencies*
