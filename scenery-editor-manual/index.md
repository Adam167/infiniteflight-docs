## Guide Version: 21.7.0



Welcome to the Scenery Editor Guide, designed to help newly qualified and veteran editors alike, bring 3D airports to Infinite Flight. Feedback is an essential part in the development & upkeep of the Scenery Editor Guide and can be raised via the IFC in the [Scenery Editing Category](https://community.infiniteflight.com/c/scenery-editing/47). 



There are currently three types of editing, Editors **must**{.red} ensure they fall within one of these categories when editing *(see [1A.3.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/1a.-administration/1a.3-editor-rules#1a.3.2) below)*:

- A 2D* only edit of a non-3D airport
- A 2D edit of a current 3D airport (with the requirement to change the 3D elements if affected by the 2D changes)
- A 2D and 3D edit of a non-3D Airport



**2D editing is defined as: visual fixes to lines, aprons, runways and taxiways. The creation of a taxi network or the naming and connecting of taxiways. Updating and checking airport date including, but not limited to, names, ICAO codes and frequencies*
