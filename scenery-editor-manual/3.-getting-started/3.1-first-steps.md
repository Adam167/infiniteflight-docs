> Airport editing often requires coordinates which can be provided in a variety of formats. [www.earthpoint.us/convert.aspx](http://www.earthpoint.us/convert.aspx) can be helpful to convert them into the desired format







Open SAS and navigate to your desired airport. If you are using SAS you can choose from various maps. Construction sites, outdated imagery and low image quality can make editing quite hard, especially for a new editor. If your desired airport has low quality imagery and/or significant construction sites impeding editing in SAS consider postponing the airport to a later date when more recent or higher quality imagery may be available to avoid frustration and/or unassigning.



"bottom up" mentality for making airports



airport properties

satellite imagery

airport boundary

pavements

taxiways / lines

lights

buildings

objects



Small airports, editors choice, large airports, recommend you do it in the order but for chunks of the airport at a time rather than all lights, then all buildings etc



### 3.1.2

Below are the first steps to be followed when editing an airport:

Step 1

: Open the Infinite Flight App and select "Scenery Editor"



Step 2

: Choose the airport that you wish to edit (this may have been assigned) and then select any runway or parking position. Hit "Ok" to begin



Step 3

: Download the Open Street Map (OSM) data by tapping "File" **(1)** and then "Download OSM" **(2)**

Tip

: If you have previously downloaded the OSM but subsequently delete some buildings in error (and these changes are saved), it may be more appropriate to use "Download OSM at Cursor". This option will only download the data within 200m of the cursor on the map, and may help avoid duplicate buildings being downloaded (which could result from using the "Download OSM" button)



Step 4

: Delete all buildings outside of the airport boundary by tapping on or near the blue circle that is in the center of the building **(3)** and then tapping "Delete Selection" **(4)** on the right side of the screen. You can also tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to select multiple buildings (a white box will appear to show the catchment area)

Step 5

: You can then move onto editing the airport and it is your choice what you start with



Tip

: Remember to regularly save and upload your work. You can do this by tapping "File" and then "Save", or "File", "File Manager" and then "Upload" respectively 



Step 6

: If you are editing a new airport (or working on an existing one which does not have a thread on the IFC yet), a topic will automatically be created in the [Scenery Editor Category](https://community.infiniteflight.com/c/scenery-editing/47). Whenever new versions are uploaded, the changelogs will be added automatically to each thread so it's easy to keep track. All communication about a particular airport **must**{.red} remain within it's specific thread
