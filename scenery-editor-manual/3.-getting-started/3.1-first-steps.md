# 3.1 First Steps



## Airport Information Resources

### 3.1.1

To find information on airport facts and figures, we recommend the following websites:

> Airport editing often requires coordinates which can be provided in a variety of formats. [www.earthpoint.us/convert.aspx](http://www.earthpoint.us/convert.aspx) can be helpful to convert them into the desired format



## Opening the Scenery Editor

### 3.1.2

Step 1

: Open the Infinite Flight App and select "Scenery Editor"



Step 2

: Choose the airport that you wish to edit (this may have been assigned) and then select any runway or parking position. Tap "Ok" and then "Open" to begin



Step 3

: If you are editing a new airport (or working on an existing one which does not have a thread on the IFC yet), a topic will automatically be created in the [Scenery Editor Category](https://community.infiniteflight.com/c/scenery-editing/47). Whenever new versions are uploaded, the changelogs will be added automatically to each thread so it's easy to keep track. All communication about a particular airport **must**{.red} remain within it's specific thread



## Editing Summary

### 3.1.3

Editors **should**{.red} try to edit airports with a "bottom up" mentality (i.e. start with everything at the bottom such as imagery and taxiways and work your way up to 3D objects). A summary of the steps that **should**{.red} be followed is below:



Step 1

: Look at the available imagery quality (within SASPlanet) to check if it is okay (zoom level 19 or higher), if it is blurry then it will not be worth starting *(see [4.1.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/4.-satellite-imagery/4.1-satellite#4.1.2) below)*



Step 2

: Compile charts and other sources to assist (some areas do not have free or public charts available)



Step 3

: Adjust airport properties *(see [3.3](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/3.-getting-started/3.3-airport-properties) below)*



Step 4

: First check that the runway in the correct location using the coordinates then you can use this as a reference point for the satellite imagery



> Most of the time the runway is already in the correct position



Step 5

: Export satellite imagery from SASPlanet and then import into Infinite Flight *(see [4.2.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/4.-satellite-imagery/4.2-exporting-imagery#4.2.1) and [4.3.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/4.-satellite-imagery/4.3-importing-imagery#4.3.1) below)*



Step 6

: Ensure airport boundary is accurate, and adjust if required *(see [3.4.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/3.-getting-started/3.4-airport-boundary#3.4.1) below)*



Step 7

: Add and adjust pavements, taxiways and lines *(see [5.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/5.-taxiways-and-pavements/5.1-selection-and-placement) below)*



Step 8

: Add lights, taxiway names and taxiway network *(see [5.2.3](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/5.-taxiways-and-pavements/5.2-properties#5.2.3) below)*



Step 9

: Download OSM *(see [3.1.4](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/3.-getting-started/3.1-first-steps#3.1.4) below)* and then add buildings *(see [6.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/6.-buildings-and-facades/6.1-selection-and-placement) below)*



Step 10

: Add objects *(see [7.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/7.-objects/7.2-selection-and-placement) below)*



Tip

: When editing larger airports, it may be easier to do "chunks" or sections of an airport at a time, and complete that section before moving onto another area of the airport



## Downloading OSM for Building Placement

### 3.1.4

Step 1

: Download the Open Street Map (OSM) data by tapping "File" **(1)** and then "Download OSM" **(2)**



![Image 3.1.4.1 - Downloading OSM](_images/manual/frames/downloading-osm.png)



Tip

: If you have previously downloaded the OSM but subsequently delete some buildings in error (and these changes are saved), it may be more appropriate to use "Download OSM at Cursor". This option will only download the data within 200m of the cursor on the map, and may help avoid duplicate buildings being downloaded (which could result from using the "Download OSM" button)



Step 2

: Delete all buildings outside of the airport boundary by tapping on or near the blue circle that is in the center of the building **(3)** and then tapping "Delete Selection" **(4)** on the right side of the screen. You can also tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to select multiple buildings (a white box will appear to show the catchment area)



![Image 3.1.4.2 - Deleting OSM Buildings](_images/manual/frames/deleting-osm-buildings.png)



Tip

: Remember to regularly save and upload your work. You can do this by tapping "File" and then "Save", or "File", "File Manager" and then "Upload" respectively
