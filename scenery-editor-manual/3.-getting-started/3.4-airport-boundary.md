# 3.4 Airport Boundary



### 3.4.1

The airport boundary is shown in a light green line that surrounds the airport, the elevation within the airport boundary will always be completely flat to allow editing and prevent any buildings/objects from floating or being submerged. All topography outside of the airport boundary will have a varying elevation based on real world topography.



Tip

: If you find buildings/objects are floating/submerged, it may be because they are too close to the airport boundary, you can either move the airport boundary or move the buildings/objects slightly in from the boundary
