### 2.1.1

![Image 2.1.1.1 - Scenery Editor Screen](_images/manual/frames/scenery-editor-screen.png)



1. The management buttons allow you to manage files, edit recent activity, change the view, adjust object altitude, add/change pavements/taxiways/buildings and import satellite imagery *(see [2.1.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.2) below)*

    

2. When a new editing session is started (even if you remain in-app), it will reset the "Last Saved" on the bottom bar to "N/A" 

   

   > Anything previously saved will still be there as the "last saved" information is only specific to the current editing session)

   

3. The main navigation bar allows you to change between the library of objects, properties and loaded items *(see [2.1.3](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.3) below)*

  ​    

4. The edit buttons allow you to move, copy & paste, edit or delete selected buildings, objects and taxiways *(see [2.1.4](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.4) below)*

  ​    

5. The camera in use can be changed here *(see [2.1.5](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.5) below)*

    

6. The settings page can be shown by tapping this button *(see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) below)*

## Camera

### 2.1.5

Tip

: Currently it is recommended to use the "Airport/Scen Editor" and "Birds Eye View" cameras when editing however the "Free" camera is particularly useful for positioning the ATC Tower

## Settings

### 2.1.6

Currently there are no new settings. Please look at the [Getting Started Guide](https://infiniteflight.com/guide/getting-started-guide/home-user-interface/settings) for more information. 



## In-App Ruler

### 2.1.7

To use the ruler, follow the steps below:



Step 1

: Place two fingers on your device's screen and hold



Step 2

: A rule will appear (both fingers must remain on the screen whilst using the ruler)



Step 3

: The ruler can then be used to measure by sliding your two fingers on the screen. It will provide measurements in meters, feet and nautical miles as well as bearing information 



Tip

: Make sure to have on screen what you would like to measure (the ruler will disappear if you try to move the camera)



Step 4

: When you are finished with the ruler, simply remove your fingers from the screen



Tip

: The ruler is only accurate on the ground
