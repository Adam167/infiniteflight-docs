# 4.1 Satellite



## Overview

### 4.1.1

Satellite imagery is used to assist Editors in creating accurate airports. SASPlanet is the recommended program as it is capable of exporting orthophotos from various sources such as Google, Bing or Yandex maps in varying quality. Files downloaded will be zipped as a .7z file and therefore WinRAR, 7Zip or similar will be required to unzip these. Links to download these programs are below:



> SASPlanet is only available on Windows and Linux. MacOS users will need to request orthophotos from other Editors



| Program                                                      | Purpose           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| [SASPlanet](https://gisenglish.geojamal.com/2018/06/download-sas-planet-nightly-all.html) | Satellite imagery |
| [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/download.html?&L=0) or [7Zip](https://www.7-zip.org) | Unzip .7z files   |



Tip

: Construction sites, outdated imagery and low image quality can make editing quite hard, especially for a new Editor. If your desired airport has low quality imagery and/or significant construction sites impeding editing in SAS, consider postponing the airport to a later date until more recent or higher quality imagery is available



## Installing SASPlanet

The following steps **should**{.red} be followed to extract the file:



Step 1

: Right click the .7z folder and select "7-zip - Extract files"



Step 2

Step 3

: Open the folder and create a shortcut to the SASPlanet Application in your Airport Editing folder (to ease access)



Step 4

Tip

: To keep your satellite imagery supply up to date, check the current map version regularly (once sources such as Google update images, a new SAS version quickly becomes available)

Tip

: Construction sites, outdated imagery and low image quality can make editing quite hard, especially for a new Editor. If your desired airport has low quality imagery and/or significant construction sites impeding editing in SAS, consider postponing the airport to a later date until more recent or higher quality imagery is available
