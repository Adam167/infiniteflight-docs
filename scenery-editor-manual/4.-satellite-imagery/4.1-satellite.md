# 4.1 Satellite



### 4.1.1

Satellite imagery is used to assist Editors in creating accurate airports. SASPlanet is the recommended program as it is capable of exporting orthophotos from various sources such as Google, Bing or Yandex maps in varying quality. Files downloaded will be zipped as a .7z file and therefore WinRAR, 7Zip or similar will be required to unpack these. Links to download these programs are below:



> SASPlanet is only available on Windows and Linux. MacOS users will need to request orthophotos from other Editors
