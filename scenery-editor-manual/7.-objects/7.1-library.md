+++ Stand Guidance

| Image         | Object Name | Notes |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----- |
| Not Available | Safedock T1 |       |



Step 1

: Scroll up/down the list on the right of the screen to see the object repository (the "Library" tab must be selected)



Step 2

: Select the "Safedock T1" under "Stand Guidance"



Step 3

: Tap in the area of the airport that you want to add the object to (you may have to press and hold), this will place a white cursor. Adjust this as required and then tap "Add Object"



Tip

: You may find it easiest to place the stand guidance at the start location for that stand by tapping the start location (you may have to select the start location from a dropdown list)



Step 4

: Three circles will appear as well as a compass rose. Tap and hold on circle to move the object or to change height/orientation:



| Circle                         | Function                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Center                         | Will move the object by dragging your finger to the desired location |
| Top (just above center circle) | Will adjust the elevation or altitude of the object          |
| Outer                          | Will change the orientation of the object by dragging your finger in the direction you want to orientate it to |



Tip

: The stand guidance **should**{.red} be eye level with the aircraft that are designed to park at that stand, and **must**{.red} be positioned in the correct location for that stand (this may be on the terminal building or even on a "Generic Pole")



Step 5

: The stand guidance **must**{.red} be facing the start location, and in the correct orientation (i.e the side with sensors **must**{.red} facing the start location)



Tip

: You may find it useful to zoom out to ensure that the stand guidance is pointing towards (and in-line with) the start location

+++ Bundles



Various bundles are available to save Editors time by inserting a group of objects that are typical for a particular location, for example the "Remote Parking" contains the objects that are typically found at remote parking locations. Custom bundles can also be made and shared by following the below steps:



Step 1

: Add the objects that you would like to bundle together *(see [7.2.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/7.-objects/7.2-selection-and-placement#7.2.2) below)*



Step 2

: Tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to select all the objects (a white box will appear to show the catchment area). All blue dots that represent each object will turn magenta to show the objects that have been selected



Step 3

: Tap "File" and then "Save Selected as Bundle" on the left of the screen



Step 4

: Name the bundle and then tap "OK". The bundle will appear under "Bundles" in the "Library" on the right of the screen



Step 5

: Any bundle can be shared by selecting the bundle from the "Library" and then tapping "File" and "Share Selected Bundle" from the left of the screen

+++ Airplanes



Different aircraft types are available, these can be used as place holders to ensure other objects allow aircraft clearance (such as when placing objects close to a parking location)
