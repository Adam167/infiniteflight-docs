# 7.3 Properties

### 7.3.1

Step 1

: Select the object by tapping on or near the blue circle that is in the center of the object. You can also tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to select multiple objects (a white box will appear to show the catchment area)



Step 2

: The circle will turn magenta to indicate it has been selected **(1)**. If there are multiple objects in close proximity, a list will appear so you can select the object you want



Step 3

: Tap the "Properties" tab **(2)** on the right side of the screen

Step 4

: You can then adjust the following properties:



| Button               | Function                                                     | Notes                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Scale                | Tap the "+/-" symbols to adjust the scale of the object      | Really useful for making objects match in size what you see from external sources (e.g. lighting AC units and blast deflectors etc.) |
| Orientation          | Tap the "+/-" symbols to adjust the orientation of the object |                                                              |
| Animations           | This will show if an object (such as a jetbridge) has built in animations |                                                              |
| Latitude / Longitude | Current latitude/longitude of the building                   |                                                              |
| Altitude             | This shows the current altitude (in meters) of the object. Tap the number and then enter in a new value to adjust this | Always based on the bottom of the surface they you are working from. Can be adjusted here manually or go to Object > auto altitude if you're doing layering for example |
| Name                 | You can name the object using this field                     |                                                              |



## Jetbridges

### 7.3.2

Under animations, the following options are available:

| Button        | Function                                                     | Notes                                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Base Rotation | Tap the "+/-" symbols to adjust the orientation of the jetbridge, it is based on a default position from the base/connector and rotates counter clockwise | Orientation in [Properties](/guide/scenery-editor/user-interface/editor-screen#navigation-bar) can be used for the same function |
| Height        | Tap the "+/-" symbols to adjust the height of the jetbridge floor | Use to match the level of the aircraft door (some stands accept multiple aircraft types and so you can just pick a default height that would cater to most in these cases) |
| Extension     | Tap the "+/-" symbols to adjust the length of the jetbridge  | Try to match the jetbridge length with the external sources being used |
| Head Rotation | Tap the "+/-" symbols to moves the head of the jetbridge     | Adjust to be parallel with aircraft door                     |
| Columns       | Tap the "+/-" symbols to adjust the column height at the end of a jetbridge | Use to ensure that wheels are not above or below ground level |



Tip

: When adjusting height and column height for low aircraft, if the jetbridge is fully (or close to being fully) extended it can be difficult to get the jetbridge low enough without the wheels being "submerged" in the ground. Avoid this by reducing the extension or by setting the height slightly above the aircraft door
