As well as the properties listed above, Jet Bridges have two other sets of properties, these are "Gates" and "Animations". **Animations must not be edited under any circumstances**{.red}.



+++ Gates

The Stowed Properties can be adjusted to ensure that the jet bridge is not in the aircraft movement area of the gate.
