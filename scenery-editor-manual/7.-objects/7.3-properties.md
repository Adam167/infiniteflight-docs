# 7.3 Properties



## General

### 7.3.1

Step 1

: Select the object by tapping on or near the blue circle that is in the center of the object. You can also tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to select multiple objects (a white box will appear to show the catchment area)



Step 2

: The circle will turn magenta to indicate it has been selected **(1)**. If there are multiple objects in close proximity, a list will appear so you can select the object you want



Step 3

: Tap the "Properties" tab **(2)** on the right side of the screen

Step 4

: You can then adjust the following properties:



| Button               | Function                                                     | Notes                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Scale                | Tap the "+/-" symbols to adjust the scale of the object      | Really useful for making objects match in size what you see from external sources (e.g. lighting AC units and blast deflectors etc.) |
| Orientation          | Tap the "+/-" symbols to adjust the orientation of the object |                                                              |
| Animations           | This will show if an object (such as a jetbridge) has built in animations |                                                              |
| Latitude / Longitude | Current latitude/longitude of the building                   |                                                              |
| Altitude             | This shows the current altitude (in meters) of the object. Tap the number and then enter in a new value to adjust this | Always based on the bottom of the surface they you are working from. Can be adjusted here manually or go to Object > auto altitude if you're doing layering for example |
| Name                 | You can name the object using this field                     |                                                              |



## Jet Bridge Properties

### 7.3.2

As well as the general properties listed above, Jet Bridges have two other sets of properties, these are "Gates" and "Animations". Animations **must not**{.red} be edited under any circumstances so only the Gate properties are listed below:

| Button               | Function                                                     | Notes                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Stowed Arm Rotation  | Tap the "+/-" symbols to adjust the orientation of the jet bridge, it is based on a default position from the base/connector and rotates counter clockwise |                                                              |
| Stowed Arm Extension | Tap the "+/-" symbols to adjust the stowed length of the jet bridge |                                                              |
| Stowed Head Rotation | Tap the "+/-" symbols to move the stowed head of the jet bridge |                                                              |
| Default Height       | Tap the "+/-" symbols to adjust the default height of the jet bridge when in the stowed position |                                                              |
| Scale                | Tap the "+/-" symbols to adjust the scale                    | Scale **must not**{.red} be changed unless it is to revert the jet bridge to a scale of "1" (**must**{.red} be 1 for animations to work) |
| Orientation          | Tap the "+/-" symbols to adjust the orientation of the jet bridge animation range (shown as a green curved cylinder shape around the jet bridge itself) |                                                              |

> The Stowed Properties can be adjusted to ensure that the jet bridge is not in the aircraft movement area of the gate



## Start Location Properties

### 7.3.3

As well as the general properties listed above, Start Locations have some additional properties which are listed below: 

| Button              | Function                                                     | Notes                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Terminal            | You can name the terminal using this field                   | The format that **should**{.red} be used: "Concourse/Terminal [name/number]" |
| Ramp Size           | The maximum size aircraft category that can spawn and park on that stand is determined with this setting | See [3.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/3.-getting-started/3.2-aircraft-categories) above |
| Ramp Start Type     | N/A                                                          | Not required at this time.                                   |
| Ramp Operation Type | N/A                                                          | Not required at this time.                                   |
| Equipment Type      | N/A                                                          | Not required at this time.                                   |
| Gate Stops          | Gate stops for different aircraft types at the same start location | See [7.3.4](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/7.-objects/7.3-properties#7.3.4) below |
| Stand Guidance      | N/A                                                          | This is automatically loaded when the app is launched in flight mode |
| Name                | You can name the gate using this field                       | The format that **should**{.red} be used: "Gate [alphanumeric/number]" - Editors **must** ensure that terminal names (e.g. T1) are not included in the "Name" property |



### 7.3.4

To add/delete or edit gate stops, the below steps **must**{.red} be followed: 



Step 1

: Tap the "+" symbol next to "Gate Stops" **(1)**



Step 2

: All gate stops currently listed for that start location will appear beneath, if there are none it will be blank. Tap the "+" symbol underneath this on the right to add more **(2)**



Step 3

: A line saying "No Types Specified" will appear. To the left of this will be a "+" symbol **(3)**, tap this to expand the gate stop so aircraft types and the offset can be set



![Image 5.3.4.1 - Adding Gate Stops](_images/manual/frames/5.3.4.1.png)



Step 4

: The same symbol will then change to a "-" symbol **(4)**, tap it again to hide this expanded information



Step 5

: When the list is expanded for each gate stop, tap "Aircraft Type" **(5)** to add aircraft types, a list will appear that you can add from



Step 6

: Tap "Offset" **(6)** to add an offset in meters for the gate stop, this will be the distance from the start location to the point that you want certain aircraft types to stop at



Step 7

: You will then see the new gate stop appear with the aircraft types applicable



Tip

: If multiple aircraft have the same offset, add all these aircraft types to one stop gate rather than making multiple ones
