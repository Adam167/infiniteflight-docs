# 7.5 Jet Bridges Animations 



### 7.5.1

Once start locations and jet bridges have been added *(see [7.2.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/7.-objects/7.2-selection-and-placement#7.2.1) and [7.2.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/7.-objects/7.2-selection-and-placement#7.2.2) above)* then Editors can move onto adding jet bridge animation. Below are the first steps that **must**{.red} be followed:



Step 1

: Check that Airport Properties *(see [3.3.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/3.-getting-started/3.3-airport-properties#3.3.2) above)* has the "Jet Bridges Available" tick box selected (orange tick when selected) by tapping "File > Airport Properties > Jet Bridges Available"



> Jet bridges will not work in flight mode for pilots until this tick box is selected



Step 2

: Check all start locations are named correctly (**must**{.red} be completed before moving onto Step 3):



| Property | Entry                            |
| -------- | -------------------------------- |
| Terminal | Concourse/Terminal [name/number] |
| Name     | Gate [alphanumeric/number]*      |

**Editors **must** ensure that terminal names (e.g. T1) are not included in the "Name" property*



Step 3

: Tap the "Auto Assign Gates" button to bind each jet bridge to a stand



Step 4

: Check all start locations for errors such as jet bridges not reaching doors. To do this, tap "Jet Bridges" and then "Check Jet Bridges"



Step 5

: Next to each start location it will either be green, red, amber or grey



| Code                                              | Message                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "All Airplanes OK" - Green                        | For any start location that has a jet bridge, this **must**{.red} be the code displayed |
| "Jet Bridges [Aircraft Type* and Reason]" - Amber | Readjustment of the jet bridge is required as it is unable to reach some aircraft/doors (partial) |
| "Jet Bridges [Aircraft Type* and Reason]" - Red   | Readjustment of the jet bridge is required as it is unable to reach the aircraft type listed |
| "No Jet Bridge Available" - Grey                  | Expected if the start location does not have a jet bridge    |

**No more than 2 aircraft types will ever be shown to avoid clutter*



> Each gate will show a report of aircraft that have issues based on specific categories (smaller aircraft types are not shown but it is safe to assume they are OK)



## Adjusting Jet Bridges

### 7.5.2

Step 1

: All jet bridges **must**{.red} be checked, adjust any jet bridge that are red, amber or grey (for a start location that has a jet bridge) by first tapping "Jet Bridges" and then "Check Jet Bridges"



> Editors **must**{.red} ensure that even jet bridges that are green comply with Step 6 below



Tip

: Tap "Jet Bridges" and then "Freeze Non Jet Bridges" before attempting to move jet bridges, this freezes all other objects so you don't move something else by accident



Step 2

: Tap the end of the jet bridge **(1)**, a green curved cylinder shape will appear that shows the animation range of the jet bridge **(2)**



> The outer green curved line shows the reach of the center of the jet bridge rotation head 



Step 3

: Two circles will appear as well as a compass rose. Use the outer circle to change the orientation of the jet bridge by tapping, holding and then dragging your finger on this circle **(3)**. You can also use the "Orientation" under "Properties" *(see [7.3.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/7.-objects/7.3-properties#7.3.2) above)*. This can be moved until the green curved cylinder shape is in an area that includes the start locations



![Image 7.5.2.1 - Adjusting Jet Bridges](_images/manual/frames/7.5.2.1.png)



Tip

: If the jet bridge still does not reach, you can tap "Jet Bridges" and then "Use Long Jetbridge" and this may increase the range required for that start location



Step 4

: If when the jet bridge is tapped, the green curved cylinder shape is facing the wrong direction **(4)**, then tap the "Rotate Range +90" button **(5)**, this will move the jet bridge range to the correct side



![Image 7.5.2.2 - Rotate Range +90 Degrees](_images/manual/frames/7.5.2.2.png)



Step 5

: Re-tap "Jet Bridges" and then "Check Jet Bridges" and check to see that the locations are now shown in green **(6)**



![Image 7.5.2.3 - Check Jet Bridges](_images/manual/frames/7.5.2.3.png)



Step 6

: Editors **must**{.red} ensure that the green curved cylinder shape covers as much of the start location as possible **(7)**. If more of the green curved cylinder shape is in an unusable position (such as the terminal), it could limit the jet bridge range **(8)**

![Image 7.5.2.5 - Incorrect Jet Bridge Set-Up](_images/manual/frames/7.5.3.5b.png)





## Changing the Stowed Position

### 7.5.3

Step 1

: Adjust the stowed position of each jet bridge by tapping "Properties" and then the "+/-" symbols to ensure that each jet bridge is not in the aircraft movement area *(see [7.3.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/7.-objects/7.3-properties#7.3.2) above)*



Step 2

: Make sure to check the default height of jet bridges and raise the default height if required *(see [7.3.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/7.-objects/7.3-properties#7.3.2) above)*. Sometimes the wheels will go into the ground if they are set too long and angled down too much (this is only for the stowed position)



Tip

: Animation properties (such as columns) are automatically adjusted in-app, therefore no adjustment of these is required outside - "Animations" **must not**{red} be edited under any circumstances



## Incorrect Gate Assignment

### 7.5.4

If it is found that a jet bridge has been incorrectly assigned to the wrong gate, this can be fixed by following the below steps:



Step 1

: Tap on the start location to confirm which jet bridges are assigned



Step 2

: Above each jet bridge, it will show the start location the jet bridge is assigned to (e.g. "Terminal 5/Gate 515")



Step 3

: If this is incorrect, tap the jet bridge required (if not already selected), then "Properties". Under "General" there is the "Gate" tab, tap this



Step 4

: The gates that are assigned to this jet bridge will be listed, these can be added/removed by tapping the "+/-" symbol respectively



## A380 Jet Bridge Operation

### 7.5.5 

If the start location has three jet bridges, it will try to join the third jet bridge to door U1L (Upper 1 Left) of the A380. Editors **should**{.red} try to raise the base of the jet bridge *(see [7.3.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/7.-objects/7.3-properties#7.3.1) above)* as well as the default height *(see [7.3.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/7.-objects/7.3-properties#7.3.2) above)* to reduce the angle of the jet bridge when connected to the aircraft door. 



### 7.5.6

To adjust the height of the base of the jet bridge, the following steps **must**{.red} be followed: 



Step 1

: Select the jet bridge base by tapping on or near the blue circle **(1)** that is in the center of the it. You can also tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to select it



Step 2

: If there are multiple objects in close proximity, a list will appear so you can select the object you want



Step 3

: Tap the "Properties" tab **(2)** on the right side of the screen and then the "+" symbol next to "Animations" **(3)**



Step 4

: A drop down list will appear, tap the "+" symbol next to "Height" **(4)**



Step 5

: This will further expand and by tapping this **(5)**, will allow you to change the height of the jet bridge base



Tip

: If the base of the jet bridge is changed, all connectors and jet bridge sections will also need to be adjusted to the same height *(see [7.5.7](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/7.-objects/7.5-jet-bridges-animations#7.5.7) below)*



![Image 7.5.6.1 - Adjusting Jet Bridge Height](_images/manual/frames/7.5.6.1c.png)



### 7.5.7

If multiple elements of a jet bridge need their height adjusted such as a long series of jet bridge bases, connections and ends, these can be done at the same time by using the "Adjust Jet Bridge Alt" button. To do this, the following steps **must**{.red} be followed: 



Step 1

: First complete all steps shown previously *(see [7.5.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/7.-objects/7.5-jet-bridges-animations#7.5.6) above)*



Step 2

: Whilst the first element of the jet bridge is still selected (which has the adjusted height) - tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to select all remaining parts of the jet bridge that you want the height adjusted for (a white box will appear to show the catchment area)



Step 3

: Tap "Jet Bridge" and then "Adjust Jet Bridge Alt"



Step 4

: The height will be changed for all selected parts of the jet bridge to the same as the height of the first selected



## Jet Bridges used for both Narrow-body and Wide-body Aircraft



### 7.5.8

Editors **should**{.red} take into account the potential angle that jet bridges may be at when connected to aircraft and ensure that the base height of the jet bridge is appropriate for all aircraft types that can spawn at that start location. Below is an example of a jet bridge which has not been adjusted to accommodate narrow body aircraft.



![Image 7.5.8.1 - Jet Bridge Base Too High for Narrow-Body Aircraft](_images/manual/frames/7.5.7.1b.png)



### 7.5.9

To change this, the same process as adjusting jet bridges for the A380 **must**{.red} be followed *(see [7.5.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/7.-objects/7.5-jet-bridges-animations#7.5.6) above)*.
