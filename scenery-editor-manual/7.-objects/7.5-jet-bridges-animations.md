# 7.5 Jet Bridges Animations 



### 7.5.1

Once start locations and jet bridges have been added *(see [7.2.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/7.-objects/7.2-selection-and-placement#7.2.1) and [7.2.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/7.-objects/7.2-selection-and-placement#7.2.2) above)* then Editors can move onto adding jet bridge animation. Below are the first steps that **must**{.red} be followed:



Step 1

: Check all start locations are named correctly (**must**{.red} be completed before moving onto Step 2):



| Property | Entry                       |
| -------- | --------------------------- |
| Terminal | Terminal [name/number]      |
| Name     | Gate [alphanumeric/number]* |

**Editors **must** ensure that terminal names (e.g. T1) are not included in the "Name" property*



Step 2

: Tap the "Auto Assign Gates" button to bind each jet bridge to a stand



Step 3

: Check all start locations for errors such as jet bridges not reaching doors. To do this, tap "Jet Bridges" and then "Check Jet Bridges"



Step 4

: Next to each start location it will either be green, red, amber or grey



| Code                                              | Message                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "All Airplanes OK" - Green                        | For any start location that has a jet bridge, this **must**{.red} be the code displayed |
| "Jet Bridges [Aircraft Type* and Reason]" - Amber | Readjustment of the jet bridge is required as it is unable to reach some aircraft/doors (partial) |
| "Jet Bridges [Aircraft Type* and Reason]" - Red   | Readjustment of the jet bridge is required as it is unable to reach the aircraft type listed |
| "No Jet Bridge Available" - Grey                  | Expected if the start location does not have a jet bridge    |

**No more than 2 aircraft types will ever be shown to avoid clutter*



> Each gate will show a report of aircraft that have issues based on specific categories (smaller aircraft types are not shown but it is safe to assume they are OK)



## Adjusting Jet Bridges

### 7.5.2

Step 1

: Adjust any jet bridge that is red, amber or grey (for a start location that has a jet bridge) by first tapping "Jet Bridges" and then "Check Jet Bridges"



Tip

: Tap "Jet Bridges" and then "Freeze Non Jet Bridges" before attempting to move jet bridges, this freezes all other objects so you don't move something else by accident



Step 2

: Tap the end of the jet bridge **(1)**, a green curved cylinder shape will appear that shows the range of the jet bridge **(2)**



> The green curved cylinder shape shows the position of the center of the head, not the total reach including the rotation head



Step 3

: Two circles will appear as well as a compass rose. Only use the outer circle to change the orientation of the jet bridge by tapping, holding and then dragging your finger on this circle **(3)**. This can be moved until the green curved cylinder shape is in an area that includes the start locations

Tip

: If the jet bridge still does not reach, you can tap "Jet Bridges" and then "Use Long Jetbridge" and this may increase the range required for that start location



Step 4

: If when the jet bridge is tapped, the green curved cylinder shape is facing the wrong direction **(4)**, then tap the "Rotate Range +90" button **(5)**, this will move the jet bridge range to the correct side



![Image 7.5.2.2 - Rotate Range +90 Degrees](_images/manual/frames/7.5.2.2.png)



Step 5

: Re-tap "Jet Bridges" and then "Check Jet Bridges" and check to see that the locations are now shown in green **(6)**

## Changing the Stowed Position

### 7.5.3

Step 1

: Adjust the stowed position of each jet bridge by tapping "Properties" and then the "+/-" symbols to ensure that each jet bridge is not in the aircraft movement area *(see [7.3.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/7.-objects/7.3-properties#7.3.2) above)*.



Step 2

: Make sure to check the default height of jet bridges and raise the default height if required. Sometimes the wheels will go into the ground if they are set too long and angled down too much (this is only for the stowed position)



Tip

: Animation properties (such as columns) are automatically adjusted in-app, therefore no adjustment of these is required outside - **"Animations" must not be edited under any circumstances**{.red}



## Incorrect Gate Assignment

### 7.5.4

If it is found that a jet bridge has been incorrectly assigned to the wrong gate, this can be fixed by following the below steps:



Step 1

: Tap on the start location to confirm which jet bridges are assigned



Step 2

: Under each jet bridge, it will show the start location the jet bridge is assigned too (e.g. "Gate 4")



Step 3

: If this is incorrect, tap the jet bridge required, then "Properties". Under "General" there is the "Gate" tab, tap this



Step 4

: The gates that are assigned to this jet bridge will be listed, these can be removed by tapping the "-" symbol
