# 5.2 Properties

### 5.2.1

Step 1

: Select the taxiway/pavement by tapping on or near the taxiway/pavement. You can also tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to select multiple taxiways/pavements (a white box will appear to show the catchment area)



Step 2

: You may have to select the taxiway/pavement from a drop down box if there are multiple in close proximity. The outline of the taxiway/pavement will turn magenta to indicate it has been selected **(1)**



Step 3

: Tap the "Properties" tab **(2)** on the right side of the screen

Step 4

: You can then adjust the following properties for pavements:



| Button               | Function                                                     | Notes                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Surface Type         | You can change the surface type by tapping this              | Surface types that are a close match to the satellite imagery **should**{.red} be used |
| Texture Orientation  | Add any number between 0 and 360 to change the grain of the textures (orientated around true north) | This is particuarly useful to make the textures align with the direction of taxiways. You can also tap "Building" > "Auto Texture Orientation" from the management buttons on the left to do this *(see [2.1.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.2) above)* |
| Latitude / Longitude | Current latitude/longitude of the building                   |                                                              |
| Altitude             | This shows the current altitude (in meters) of the pavement. Tap the number and then enter in a new value to adjust this | The altitude is always based on the elevation of the airport |
| Name                 | You can name the pavement using this field                   | All pavements **must**{.red} be named appropriately (i.e. "Terminal 1 Apron") |



Step 5

: You can then adjust the following properties for taxiways:



| Button                | Function                                                     | Notes                                                        |

| Direction             | Two Way, Forward, Backward and None can be selected          | All lines **must**{.red} be marked as "TwoWay"               |
| Line Type             | Various types of lines can be selected                       | See [5.2.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/5.-taxiways-and-pavements/5.2-properties#5.2.1) below |
| Taxiway Network Usage | Unknown, Aircraft or None can be selected                    | All lines **must**{.red} be marked as "Aircraft" unless it is a line that is not to be part of the taxiway network (such as a road), in which case, it **must**{.red} be marked as "None" |
| Lights Type           | Various types of lights can be selected                      | See [5.2.3](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/5.-taxiways-and-pavements/5.2-properties#5.2.3) below |
| Latitude / Longitude  | Current latitude/longitude of the building                   |                                                              |
| Altitude              | This shows the current altitude (in meters) of the taxiway. Tap the number and then enter in a new value to adjust this | The altitude is always based on the elevation of the airport |
| Name                  | You can name the taxiway using this field                    | All taxiways **must**{.red} be named appropriately (i.e. "A" for Alpha taxiway) |
