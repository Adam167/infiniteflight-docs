# 5.3 Editing Taxiways



| Build Taxiway Layout | Once taxiways have been completed and labelled correctly, tapping this button will mean that routes from each start location to the runway(s) can be checked. These are color coded. If any changes are made, this button needs to be re-tapped before you can "Check Taxiway Layout" |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Check Taxiway Layout | You can tap this button after the taxiway layout has been built when adjustments have been made to check if the taxiway route from the start location to the runway(s) is valid |





Red taxiway lines are invalid - means name is incorrect e.g line 107 etc, means you know which ones are done



yellow lines will automatically be aircraft, 



| Property | Usable in Taxiway Network? |
| -------- | -------------------------- |
| None     | No                         |
| Aircraft | Yes                        |
| Unknown  | Not in use                 |







## Splitting Lines

Before naming lines, you may have to split them to ensure they can be labelled correctly and to enable Controllers to be able to select the different paths to send aircraft in. To do this, the below steps **must**{.red} be followed:



Step 1

: Tap the line that you want to split and then "Modify Shape" on the right of the screen



Step 2

: Select the node that you want to split



Step 3

: Tap "Split Line"



Step 4

: When splitting the line for the turn, it must be done at the node just as the line starts to "break off"



## Taxiway Connections

Taxiway connections are required to make a continuous path for guiding aircraft using the taxiway network. They are invisible lines that will not show on the ground and will not be included in the taxiway instruction, however allows Controllers to get aircraft from the runway to the stand (and vice versa). Below are the steps that **must**{.red} be followed to create these:



Step 1

: Create connection and set snap to type and freeze non taxi lines



Step 2

: Then tap between the remote stand and the nearest point on the taxiway that is closest, would make invisible line but allows the commands to send someone to and from the runway to that remote stand



> There is a 75 meter buffer around start locations allowing it to automatically "join" to the closest point on the taxiway lines if there are no connections present.  Therefore taxiway connections **must**{.red} be done in all cases otherwise it may invisibly connect with the closest taxiway line which could be the wrong one (such as on the other side of the stand if it is closer)



Step 3

: For runway crossings, taxiway connections need to be done instead of lines to avoid weird shapes being made in conjunction with the line up lines (see Monoray - KMRY)



## Taxiway Direction

All taxiways must be "TwoWay" unless it is marked on the chart that the taxiway is one way only. If this is the case then Editors **should**{.red} change the taxiway so that it is in the correct direction for Controllers to be able to use. 



Step 1

: Tap the line



Step 2

: Tap properties



Step 3

: Change the line direction to one way by selecting forward or backward



Tip

: The direction for forward will follow the node numbers with 0 as the starting point, the reverse is the case for backward. Editors may have to select the "opposite" of what they would expect as it is based on the node numbering



## Naming Lines



Tip

: The keyboard is the best tool for naming lines. It will also remember your last few selections for quick access and it will default to upper case when entered



Step 1

: First label all the taxiways the correct name and make sure that they are 



Step 2

: Tap "Taxiway" from the management buttons on the left of the screen, select lines, and then keyboard to rename them 



> You can rename multiple lines at the same time by tapping "Edit > Selection Add" and then selecting all the lines you want to be renamed



Tip

: Tap "Freeze Non Taxi Lines" to help avoid selecting things other than lines (to unfreeze again, tap "Edit > Unfreeze All")



Step 3

: Select lines near start and then change to network usage none to remove from the taxiway network (might not be applicable at the airport if they are already out of the network) (check somewhere like LFPG or a bigger airport)



Step 4

: Then tap select invalid taxilines (stays on regardless of zoom level), this will then show ones in magenta that haven't been done yet



Step 5

: Can then use the Set as Apron to join up and Apron is not pronucnced between that and start location



Tip

: Then finally you might need to go and find the L and R stands and mark the usage as aircraft and then name as apron



Step 6

: Remote stands need taxiway connections 



## Assigning Holds

The "Auto assign holds" button will automatically name holds per the runway (e.g. 09L-27R etc) - this **must**{.red} be done before building the taxiway layout.



Step 1

: Auto Assign holds



Step 2

: Check each hold to ensure that the correct allocation has been made (especially where a hold serves two runways)



Step 3

: If it is incorrect, this can be edited 



>  If the holds are assigned different names IRL, these can also be added (such as PLUTO at EGLL)



## Building Taxiway Network



Step 1

: Holds **must**{.red} be assigned before building the taxiway layout



Step 2

: Check Layout then tap each stand to see if it has valid path to the runway

|        |                                                              |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Red    | Does not have valid path to the runway edge                  |
| Orange | Valid path to the hold short line but does not reach the runway edge |
| Green  | Valid path to the runway edge                                |



Tip

: Use the create taxiway and roadway shortcuts to make a line that is already assigned the correct style for a taxiway and roadway
