# 5.3 Editing Taxiways



Red taxiway lines are invalid - means name is incorrect e.g line 107 etc, means you know which ones are done





yellow lines will automatically be aircraft, 



| Property | Usable in Taxiway Network? |
| -------- | -------------------------- |
| None     | No                         |
| Aircraft | Yes                        |
| Unknown  | Not in use                 |



Step 1

: First label all the taxiways the correct name and make sure that they are 





Taxiway button, select loads of lines, and then keyboard and then rename them all



You can use selection add in the edit section to add lines in groups, you can tap again to remove or use the selection remove button



Freeze Non Taxi Lines to help with selecting lines and freezing 



Select lines near start and then change to network usage none to remove from the taxiway network (might not be applicable at the airport if they are already out of the network) (check somewhere like LFPG or a bigger airport)



Then tap select invalid taxilines (stays on regardless of zoom level), this will then show ones in magenta that haven't been done yet



Can then use the Set as Apron to join up and Apron is not pronucnced between that and start location



Then finally you might need to go and find the L and R stands and mark the usage as aircraft and then name as apron





Build layout

Check Layout then tap each stand to see if it has valid path to the runway



Red does not have valid path 

Orange can reach hold short line but not runway edge

Green can reach runway edge line



Remote stands,ou will need taxiway connections



Create taxiway and roadway, shortcuts to make a line that is assigned a style for taxiway or roadway

Create connection  and set snap to type and freeze non taxi lines

Then tap between the remote stand and the nearest point on the taxiway that is cloest, would make invisible line but allows the commands to send someone to and from the runway to that remote stand



You can use name but keyboard is easier and keyboard also remembers the last few names done too

Just letters for taxiways, upper case or lower doesn't matter as automatically upper case 



Auto assign holds button (will automatically name holds per the runway e.g. 09L-27R etc) - needs to be done before building layout

You may need to check each hold after too, except if the two runways start from the same location, brussells, or miami, maybe all runwways if from same place (26L-36L-08-09L etc)



You can also name the holds as what they are called IRL, such as SATURN or PLUTO etc



Unfreeze all to unfreeze any freezes (under edit)



Tap the line

Modify shape

Select point

Split line



When split line for turn, make sure to do it at the node just as it breaks off, show pictures for this as an example



Taxiway connections need to be done across runways (straight invicisble line to avoid it making a weird shape with the line up lines)

(Monoray - KMRY)



75meters buffer between line and start location when invisble line connection not needed but beware that it might do this with the closet point so could do it through a building, therefore best to make sure it is closest otherwise



Direction



0 to 40 (forward, the node starting pointing is 0 or low number, and then high, reverse for backward)

But otherwise twoway for all other taxiways
