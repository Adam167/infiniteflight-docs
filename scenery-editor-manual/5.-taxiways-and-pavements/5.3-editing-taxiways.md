# 5.3 Editing Taxiways



Coming Soon





- add about naming taxiways, needs to match the chart, in rare cases where the airport doesn't have names for the taxiways then editors can use there discretion (most common to have A as the main taxiway parallel with the runway, and then sequentially name any taxiways off of this in order from B onwards)
- Need to add about curves and nodes (good technique, break line in middle with node, move node in line with imagery, break line in middles that were created and bring to line, continue until the line closely matches the curve in the imagery)
