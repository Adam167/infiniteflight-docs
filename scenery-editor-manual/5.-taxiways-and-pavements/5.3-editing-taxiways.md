# 5.3 Editing Taxiways



























- add about naming taxiways, needs to match the chart, in rare cases where the airport doesn't have names for the taxiways then editors can use there discretion (most common to have A as the main taxiway parallel with the runway, and then sequentially name any taxiways off of this in order from B onwards)
- Need to add about curves and nodes (good technique, break line in middle with node, move node in line with imagery, break line in middles that were created and bring to line, continue until the line closely matches the curve in the imagery) - not as relevant if you have imagery as you can just create nodes as required to match the line



Regan

- Update images
- Add 2D checklist (get from old editing doc) and then change current editor checklist to 3D checklist
- Add the taxiway and pavement stuff from mishas post from the IFC
- Technical locations, need to add 2D stuff like lights and taxiway lines (hold short lines etc), maybe general ground markings, maybe example of what a stand looks like such as remote stand vs normal stand



Misha

- Custom towers sometimes cause issues with viewpoints - Misha to check as sometimes it doesn't recognise the tower as a tower and thinks it is a building so doesn't hide it
- Come up with a list of clips for the manual (ideally that match with the various sections) for Regan to make with Jason
- If possible, make a doc of the review process so that Regan can update this in the manual, the following points were mentioned:
  - Peer Review (done whenever and encouraged) and Supervisor Reviews (when someone makes their first airport, then tag removed)
  - Supervisors will also do general reviews once airports are submitted to help with selecting release airports
  - Then if airport is selected for release then there is a final review



Step 8 of 3.1 add reference once done
