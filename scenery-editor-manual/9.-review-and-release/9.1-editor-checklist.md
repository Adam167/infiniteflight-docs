# 9.1 Editor Checklist

Tip

: Remember to regularly seek fellow editors for peer review to help get the best results at your airport!



### 9.1.1

Below is a checklist that editors **should**{.red} ensure is completed before marking an airport as complete and ready for review:



> If you leave this page, items that you have "checked off" will not be remembered. Do not navigate away or refresh this page until you have completed the checklist 



## Airport Boundary & OSM

- [ ] OSM outside of airport boundary have been confirmed to be deleted
- [ ] Objects within boundary have their altitudes set
- [ ] Duplicate buildings have been verified removed if "Download OSM" and "Download OSM at Cursor" were utilized



Tip

: Switch time and day to sunset or sunrise while conducting the secondary sweep of the airport boundary to ensure no green building outlines are visible



## Beacons

- [ ] Beacons have been added and in positions found IRL



Tip

: Utilize time of day selected to night mode and place the beacon accordingly



## Fence

- [ ] Fences are joined properly and their orientations are consistent i.e. posts and rails join smoothly, end posts marry up to buildings (where applicable) and are aligned with pavements (where applicable)
- [ ] Correct fence selection has been made i.e. barb-wire vs no barb-wire
- [ ] Motorized gates have been added at roadway entrances and exits (where applicable)
- [ ] Fence does not surround the entire airport but only in places where the fence is an important (and visible) feature 



## Fire Stations

- [ ] Fire Stations have been added respective to their locations IRL
- [ ] Fire Station drive-thru and normal engine bay heights appear realistic (i.e. Bay doors shouldn’t appear to be 3 times the height of the large firefighting apparatus)
- [ ] Fire Station roof heights have been set
- [ ] Lighting has been provided to serve the exterior of the fire stations
- [ ] Firefighting trainer aircraft has been added to 3D airport if applicable



## Gates

- [ ] Jet Bridge with base/extender *(if applicable)*
- [ ] Pushback tug *(no more than 1 per gate)*
- [ ] Belt Loader *(no more than 2 per gate)*
- [ ] Baggage Tug & Baggage Carts *(no more than 2 tugs and 6 carts)*
- [ ] ULD Loader *(no more than 2)*
- [ ] ULDs *(within reason)*
- [ ] Fuel Truck *(no more than 1 every 5 gates)*
- [ ] Stairs *(optional)*
- [ ] Cones
- [ ] Lights
- [ ] Safedock
- [ ] Support Vehicles
- [ ] Fire Truck(s)



## Hangars

- [ ] Hangars are aligned with 2D Pavements
- [ ] Building layering is symmetrical and corners are accurately positioned at all intersections
- [ ] Roof Orientations have been auto coordinated
- [ ] Facades are coordinated as close to IRL as possible
- [ ] Adequate amount of points are provided especially for large buildings to ensure they render fully without glitching or disappearing
- [ ] Roof depths have been adjusted to match IRL imagery and/or mixed up to give ramps and remote areas more character



## Hold Short Lighting

- [ ] Hold short lights have been provided at all runway intersections with Hold Lines
- [ ] Hold short lights are oriented respective to their IRL conditions either following straight taxi center lines or curved center lines so that they are visible to the PIC



## Jetbridges

- [ ] Verify that gate spawns have been appropriately named in both the "gate" & "terminal" text fields
- [ ] Auto assign jet bridges to gates using the "Auto Assign Gates" button
- [ ] Verify that the jet bridge is assigned only to the gates that it is to service (i.e. **should not**{.red} be assigned to gates on the other side of the terminal)
- [ ] Jet bridge positioned in a way that would be "stowed" by adjusting height, extension and rotation
- [ ] Ensure jet bridge reach (green curved cylinder shape) covers the gate and all doors for all available aircraft (partial coverage is not acceptable - use the "Rotate Range +90" button if required)
- [ ] Verify ground objects are clear for jet bridge wheel movement
- [ ] "Jet Bridges Available" tick box selected (orange tick when selected) by tapping "File > Airport Properties > Jet Bridges Available"



## Localizers and Glide Slope Antennas

- [ ] Localizers are perpendicular to the runways (i.e. runway heading and LOC heading are the same)
- [ ] Slope Antennas are facing the approach cone and oriented with the runway heading



## Rooftop Equipment - AC units, Catwalks, Cooling Towers, Condensing Units, Ladders

- [ ] Rooftop equipment such as air conditioners, cooling towers, ladders, catwalks and penthouses have their heights auto-coordinated
- [ ] Equipment is aligned according IRL orientation and/or are aligned perpendicular/parallel to roof walls and penthouses



## Terminals

- [ ] Terminals are aligned with 2D Pavements
- [ ] Building layering is symmetrical and corners are accurately positioned at all intersections
- [ ] Roof Orientations have been auto coordinated
- [ ] Facades are coordinated as close to IRL as possible
- [ ] Adequate amount of points are provided especially for large buildings to ensure they render fully without glitching or disappearing
- [ ] Roof depths have been adjusted to match IRL imagery and/or mixed up to give ramps and remote areas more character



## Towers

- [ ] Tower(s) is(are) aligned with 2D Pavements (where applicable)
- [ ] Building layering is symmetrical and corners are accurately positioned at all intersections
- [ ] Roof Orientations have been auto coordinated
- [ ] Facades are coordinated as close to IRL as possible
- [ ] Adequate amount of points are provided especially for large buildings to ensure they render fully without glitching or disappearing
- [ ] ATC Towers have all been provided and the heights are set to IRL tower heights
- [ ] Roof depths have been adjusted to match IRL imagery and/or mixed up to give ramps and remote areas more character



## Vehicles - Belt Loaders, Cars, Catering Truck, Fuel Trucks, Tugs

- [ ] Objects aren’t overcrowding ramps, gates, parking lots and staging areas
- [ ] No objects are clipping one another (i.e. cargo pods, dollies, baggage carts, trucks, SUVs, fuel trucks, and catering vehicles)
- [ ] Cargo pods, loaders, cones and tugs are incorporated into cargo ramps
- [ ] GA Ramps have some substance such as cones, ladders, a few vehicles, light posts, ladders, and stairs
- [ ] Airport Fire & Rescue Trucks and Vans have been added to fire stations and substations
- [ ] Vehicles are clear and free from roadways
- [ ] Vehicles, cones, stairs, carts, and dollies are clear from obstructing Jetbridges, no wing strikes, no nose wheel or engine collisions



## VORs

- [ ] VORs have been added to the 3D airport if present IRL (utilizing available imagery and airport charts)
- [ ] VOR sizing correctly portrays what is at the airport IRL i.e. VOR (small) or VOR has been placed within the airport boundary



## Windsocks

- [ ] Wind socks have been added to each runway end
- [ ] Wind socks are provided as close to IRL imagery and airport chart data (if available)
