| Direction             | Two Way, Forward, Backward and None can be selected          | All lines **must**{.red} be marked as "TwoWay" unless they are marked as one way only on the official taxiway charts |
| Line Type             | Various types of lines can be selected                       | See [5.2.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/5.-taxiways-and-pavements/5.2-properties#5.2.1) below |
| Taxiway Network Usage | Unknown, Aircraft or None can be selected                    | All lines **must**{.red} be marked as "Aircraft" unless it is a line that is not to be part of the taxiway network (such as a road), in which case, it **must**{.red} be marked as "None" |
| Lights Type           | Various types of lights can be selected                      | See [5.2.3](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/5.-taxiways-and-pavements/5.2-properties#5.2.3) below |

| Altitude              | This shows the current altitude (in meters) of the taxiway. Tap the number and then enter in a new value to adjust this | The altitude is always based on the elevation of the airport |
| Name                  | You can name the taxiway using this field                    | All taxiways **must**{.red} be named appropriately (i.e. "A" for Alpha taxiway) |
