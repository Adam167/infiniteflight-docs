# 6.2 Properties

### 6.2.1

Step 1

: Select the taxiway by tapping on or near the taxiway *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 2

: You may have to select the taxiway from a drop down box if there are multiple in close proximity. The outline of the taxiway will turn magenta to indicate it has been selected **(1)**



Step 3

: Tap the "Properties" tab **(2)** on the right side of the screen

| Direction             | Two Way, Forward, Backward and None can be selected          | All lines **must**{.red} be marked as "TwoWay" unless they are marked as one way only on the official taxiway charts |
| Line Type             | Various types of lines can be selected                       | See [6.2.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/6.-taxiways/6.2-properties#6.2.2) below |
| Taxiway Network Usage | Unknown, Aircraft or None can be selected                    | All lines **must**{.red} be marked as "Aircraft" unless it is a line that is not to be part of the taxiway network (such as a road), in which case, it **must**{.red} be marked as "None" |
| Lights Type           | Various types of lights can be selected                      | See [6.2.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/6.-taxiways/6.2-properties#6.2.2) below |
| Latitude / Longitude  | Current latitude/longitude of the taxiway                    | Changing this is not recommended                             |
| Altitude              | This shows the current altitude (in meters) of the taxiway. Tap the number and then enter in a new value to adjust this | The altitude is always based on the elevation of the airport |
| Name                  | You can name the taxiway using this field                    | All taxiways **must**{.red} be named appropriately (i.e. "A" for Alpha taxiway) |



### 6.2.2

Below are the different types of lines, lights and categories available. Lines **must**{.red} only be added when they are present IRL (details are usually found within the Airport Operational Information or ground charts):
