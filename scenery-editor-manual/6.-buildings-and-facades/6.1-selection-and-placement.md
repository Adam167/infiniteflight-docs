## Changing Orientation of a Building

### 6.1.2

Step 1

: Select the building by tapping on or near the building, you may have to select the building from a drop down list if there are multiple buildings/objects in the vicinity *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Tip

: If you have only just made the taxiway/pavement then just tap "Modify Shape" to deselect this and the taxiway/pavement will be selected



Step 2

: Three circles will appear as well as a compass rose. Tap and hold on the circle **(1)** to move the building or to change height/orientation:



| Circle                         | Function                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Center                         | Will move the building by dragging your finger to the desired location |
| Top (just above center circle) | Will adjust the elevation or altitude of the building        |
| Outer                          | Will change the orientation of the building by dragging your finger in the direction you want to orientate it to |

## Downloading OSM for Building Placement

### 6.1.5

Step 1

: Download the Open Street Map (OSM) data by tapping "File" **(1)** and then "Download OSM" **(2)**



![Image 6.1.5.1 - Downloading OSM](/Users/reganhawthorn/Documents/GitHub/infiniteflight-docs/scenery-editor-manual/3.-getting-started/_images/manual/frames/6.1.5.1a.png)



Tip

: If you have previously downloaded the OSM but subsequently delete some buildings in error (and these changes are saved), it may be more appropriate to use "Download OSM at Cursor". This option will only download the data within 200m of the cursor on the map, and may help avoid duplicate buildings being downloaded (which could result from using the "Download OSM" button)



Step 2

: Delete all buildings outside of the airport boundary by tapping on or near the blue circle that is in the center of the building **(3)** and then tapping "Delete Selection" **(4)** on the right side of the screen *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*
