# 6.3 Editing Buildings

### 6.3.1

Step 1

: Select the building by tapping on or near the building (you may have to select the building from a drop down list if there are multiple buildings/objects in the vicinity). You can also tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to select multiple buildings (a white box will appear to show the catchment area) 



Step 2

: Tap the "Modify Shape" button on the right side **(1)**



Step 3

: It will turn amber when selected and nodes will appear



Step 4

: By tapping a node it will turn magenta **(2)** to show it has been selected. You can also tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to select multiple nodes (a white box will appear to show the catchment area)



Step 5

: You can then tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to move the node(s) into the desired position



Tip

: If when moving around the airport you notice rendering issues with the buildings (i.e. a "judder" motion), the building is duplicated and one will need to be selected and deleted to fix this



Step 6

: When editing is complete, tap "Modify Shape" to deselect it (you will be unable to edit other buildings without doing this)

## Layering

### 6.3.2

The below steps highlight a good method for adding detail to buildings (layering) however you may find different methods that you prefer:



Step 1

: OSM will automatically place the buildings when downloaded *(see [3.1.4](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/3.-getting-started/3.1-first-steps#3.1.4) above)* however you may find that they do not completely align with pavements. You can move the buildings to make them more "flush" with the pavement edging *(see [6.3.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/6.-buildings-and-facades/6.3-editing-buildings#6.3.1) above)*



Tip

: We recommend changing the whole building facade to something plain (e.g. terminal 1, face 1) before starting to layer as this will make it easier for depth perception *(see [6.4.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/6.-buildings-and-facades/6.4-editing-facades#6.4.1) below)*



Step 2

: Change the building height *(see [6.2.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/6.-buildings-and-facades/6.2-properties#6.2.1) above)*. If it is a hanger you can use the minimum hangar heights for guidance *(see [3.2.3](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/3.-getting-started/3.2-aircraft-categories#3.2.3) above)*. For terminals or other complicated buildings, it is better to create multiple levels. Any level that is not the top floor should have the roof depth set to zero *(see [6.2.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/6.-buildings-and-facades/6.2-properties#6.2.1) above)*



Tip

: For terminals that have jetbridges, the first layer should be given a height of approximately 4.5 meters (varies dependant on what type of jetbridge being used). When jetbridges are then attached, the floor will align with the second layer



Step 3

: If making multiple floors, first copy & paste the first layer of the building *(see [6.1.3](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/6.-buildings-and-facades/6.1-selection-and-placement#6.1.3) above)*



Tip

: Before tapping paste, tap somewhere else on the map to avoid in-app crashes



Step 4

: Drag the newly copied building so that the outline is somewhere over the first layer of the original building *(see [6.1.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/6.-buildings-and-facades/6.1-selection-and-placement#6.1.2) above)*



Step 5

: Using the management buttons on the left of the screen, tap "Object" and then "Auto Altitude". This will raise the newly copied building to make it the second layer (roof height of the first layer). You can also set the height of the building manually if needed for the same effect *(see [6.2.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/6.-buildings-and-facades/6.2-properties#6.2.1) above)*



Step 6

: Using external sources, continue to adjust the size and shapes of the layers to replicate the overall look of the building. For passenger terminals a minimum of three layers is recommended



Tip

: Don't forget that you can also make layers that are a tiny height, this will give you the option of changing the roof colour for example without the different facade being visible to keep the building look the same



Step 7

: With every new layer added, don't forget to name it appropriately (tap on the building > select properties > tap name to edit)
