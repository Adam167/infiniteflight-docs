# 8.2 Start Locations



### 8.2.1

Selection, placement and changing orientation of start locations is done in the same way as all other objects *(see [7.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/7.-objects/7.2-selection-and-placement) above)*.



## How to see Aircraft Start Locations 

### 8.2.2

Before placing objects near aircraft start locations, it is recommended to turn on Aircraft Start Locations following these steps:



Step 1

: On the left of the screen, tap "View"



Step 2

: Then tap "Start Locations" (it will change to amber to indicate it has been selected)



Step 3

: Each start location will be represented by a blue dot. By zooming in on a start location you will be able to see the start location details including:

- Identifier (i.e. Terminal and stand number)
- Type (i.e. Gate, Tie-down, Misc or Hanger)
- Gate Size (i.e. maximum aircraft category)
- Ramp Operation Type (i.e. GA, Airline, Cargo or Military)



## Properties

### 8.2.3

As well as the general properties listed above, Start Locations have some additional properties which are listed below:

| Gate Stops          | Gate stops for different aircraft types at the same start location | See [8.2.4](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/8.-airport-gate/8.2-start-locations#8.2.4) below |
| Stand Guidance      | N/A                                                          | This is automatically loaded when the app is launched in flight mode |
| Name                | You can name the gate using this field                       | The format that **should**{.red} be used: "Gate [alphanumeric/number]" - Editors **must** ensure that terminal names (e.g. T1) are not included in the "Name" property |



## Gate Stops

### 8.2.4

To add/delete or edit gate stops, the below steps **must**{.red} be followed: 



Step 1

: Tap the "+" symbol next to "Gate Stops" **(1)**



Step 2

: All gate stops currently listed for that start location will appear beneath, if there are none it will be blank. Tap the "+" symbol underneath this on the right to add more **(2)**



Step 3

: A line saying "No Types Specified" will appear. To the left of this will be a "+" symbol **(3)**, tap this to expand the gate stop so aircraft types and the offset can be set

Step 4

: The same symbol will then change to a "-" symbol **(4)**, tap it again to hide this expanded information



Step 5

: When the list is expanded for each gate stop, tap "Aircraft Type" **(5)** to add aircraft types, a list will appear that you can add from



Step 6

: Tap "Offset" **(6)** to add an offset in meters for the gate stop, this will be the distance from the start location to the point that you want certain aircraft types to stop at



Step 7

: You will then see the new gate stop appear with the aircraft types applicable



Tip

: If multiple aircraft have the same offset, add all these aircraft types to one stop gate rather than making multiple ones
