# 12.1 Editing Overview

### 12.1.1

It is recommended that Editors use a "bottom up" mentality for editing (i.e. start with everything at the bottom such as imagery and taxiways and work your way up to 3D objects). A summary of the steps that **should**{.red} be followed is below (although these can be completed in any order that the Editor wishes):



Step 1

: Look at the available imagery quality (within SASPlanet) to check if it is okay (zoom level 19 or higher), if it is blurry then it will not be worth starting *(see [4.1.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/4.-satellite-imagery/4.1-satellite#4.1.2) above)*



Step 2

: Compile charts and other sources to assist (some areas do not have free or public charts available)



Step 3

: Adjust airport properties *(see [3.3](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/3.-getting-started/3.3-airport-properties) above)*



Step 4

: Check that the runway is in the correct location using the coordinates, you can then use this as a reference point for the satellite imagery



> Most of the time the runway is already in the correct position



Step 5

: Export satellite imagery from SASPlanet and then import into Infinite Flight *(see [4.2.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/4.-satellite-imagery/4.2-exporting-imagery#4.2.1) and [4.3.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/4.-satellite-imagery/4.3-importing-imagery#4.3.1) above)*



Step 6

: Ensure airport boundary is accurate, and adjust if required *(see [3.4.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/3.-getting-started/3.4-airport-boundary#3.4.1) above)*



Step 7

: Add and adjust pavements, taxiways and lines *(see [5.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/5.-taxiways-and-pavements/5.1-creating-taxiways-and-pavements) above)*



Step 8

: Add lights, taxiway names, taxiway network and any other properties required *(see [5.2.3](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/5.-taxiways-and-pavements/5.2-properties#5.2.3) above)*



Step 9

: Add and edit buildings *(see [6.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/6.-buildings-and-facades/6.1-selection-and-placement) above)*. You can "Download OSM" if you prefer to use this as a starting point *(see [3.1.4](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/3.-getting-started/3.1-first-steps#3.1.4) above)* 



Step 10

: Add spawns/start locations *(see [8.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/8.-airport-gate/8.2-start-locations) above)*



Step 11

: Add jet bridges *(see [8.4](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/8.-airport-gate/8.4-jet-bridges) above)* and enable jet bridge animations *(see [8.5](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/8.-airport-gate/8.5-jet-bridge-animations) above)* if applicable



Step 12

: Add objects *(see [7.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/7.-objects/7.2-selection-and-placement) above)*, including stand guidance if applicable *(see [8.3](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/8.-airport-gate/8.3-stand-guidance) above)*
