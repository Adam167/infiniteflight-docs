# 1A.4  Airport Assignments

 

### 1A.4.1    

All Editors at the rank of Apprentice (initial rank when joining) **must**{.red} have all airports assigned to them in order to upload them. This is to ensure that new Editors do not assign themselves an airport too large/complex and so that they can focus on one airport at a time, addressing any issues spotted during Peer and Official Reviews *(see [11.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/11.-review-and-release/11.1-review-and-release-process%202) below)*.



> Apprentices **must not**{.red} be assigned more than one airport at a time, unless the airport has been submitted for an Official Review. Apprentice's may be assigned (and begin editing) their next airport whilst awaiting feedback from their airport in review, but **must**{.red} prioritize completing this airport once feedback has been given



### 1A.4.2

Following successful Official Reviews from airports that have been assigned, Apprentice's will be promoted to the rank of Editor and will no longer be required to request airport assignments *(see [1A.3.2](/guide/scenery-editing-manual/1a.-administration/1a.3-rank-structure#1a.3.2) above)*.



### 1A.4.3

For an Apprentice to request an airport assignment, the following steps **must**{.red} be followed:



Step 1

: Open the Airport Editing Discord and using the navigation bar on the left side of the screen, find the "Editing" tab



Step 2

: Click on the *#airport-assignment* Discord channel



Step 3

: Post in this channel with the airport that you would like to be assigned by including the ICAO code (e.g. "I would like to be assigned EGLC" etc)



Step 4

: A Reviewer will look at the request and either approve the airport assignment or suggest an alternative if the airport is considered too large/complex for the Apprentice



> This will be in a thread underneath the request made, all further comments relating to that airport **should**{.red} be in the thread to ensure that airport assignments are not lost within the Discord channel



### 1A.4.4

When Apprentice's select an airport that they want to be assigned, consideration **should**{.red} be given to the following criteria:



- airport size and complexity
- time available
- ability
- and previous feedback given by Reviewers (if applicable)
