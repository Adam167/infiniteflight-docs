# 1A.3 Editor Rules



## General

### 1A.3.1

- Deliberate leaks will result in access to beta, editing and potentially IFC/VA accounts being removed
- All communication **must**{.red} be via the IFC Forum in the correct category, any deviation from this is treated as a leak and may be subject to the same loss of access as a deliberate leak
- On occasion, volunteers may be sought for specific airports to be completed, or if necessary, editors may be assigned a particular airport for completion
- Activity is not expected to be continuous however all editors are asked to try to maintain a consistent level (please inform us if this is not possible)
- Major hubs can take a month or more to complete if only a few hours are completed every week, or in a few days if worked on continuously
- The editing process is complex and so questions are encouraged however this manual **must**{.red} be read through in it's entirety before any editing is attempted
- Only work on airports that have been assigned, never work on an airport that has been edited unless you have permission to do so 



## Editing

### 1A.3.2

- Always delete OSM buildings not in the airport boundary
- Do not add vehicles or objects to road surfaces
- Keep objects and facades as realistic as possible
- Do not add objects to fill empty spaces if there are no objects shown on maps
- Only edit the airports allocated to you (Airport Reviewers are excluded from this and can edit any airport)
- If a terminal is under construction in the real world and it's main building sections are not yet completed, do not add it. If the building is completed but not operational, you can add it, however do not place any objects that are not present at that time. The rest of the airport can be edited as normal
- Adding customs towers **should**{.red} be avoided where possible however if you feel that it is required for the overall look of the airport, a request **must**{.red} be made beforehand for authorization
- Custom roofs **must not**{.red} have slants/curves or other highly complex structures added. You are permitted to add basic roof structures to enhance the look (so that it is not flat)
- Only one airport can be edited at a time, and other airports cannot be reserved for future work (whilst another airport is being edited)
- Do not create an IFC topic in the [Scenery Editor Category](https://community.infiniteflight.com/c/scenery-editing/47) for an airport that is being edited. If you are editing a new airport (or working on an existing one which does not have a thread on the IFC yet), a topic will automatically be created. Whenever new versions are uploaded, the changelogs will be added automatically to each thread so it's easy to keep track. All communication about a particular airport **must**{.red} remain [within it's specific thread](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/review-and-release/review-and-release-process)
- All buildings and their [different layers](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/buildings-and-facades/editing-buildings#layering) must be named appropriately (i.e. "Lvl 1 Terminal 1")



### 1A.3.3

If you are editing a new airport (or working on an existing one which does not have a thread on the IFC yet), a topic will automatically be created in the [Scenery Editor Category](https://community.infiniteflight.com/c/scenery-editing/47). Whenever new versions are uploaded, the changelogs will be added automatically to each thread so it's easy to keep track. All communication about a particular airport must remain [within it's specific thread](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/review-and-release/review-and-release-process)



Tip

: Make sure you save your airport regularly and share to yourself via email as a backup!
