# 1A.2  Discord Rules

 

Tip

: All Editors **must**{.red} ensure that their Discord Nickname is either the same as their IFC Username or real name - this means that Editors can be found easily if required *(see [1A.2.1](/guide/scenery-editing-manual/1a.-administration/1a.2-discord-rules#1a.2.1) below)*



## General

### 1A.2.1

- All Editors **must**{.red} have an Infinite Flight account
- All Editors **must**{.red} be 13 years of age or above
- All Editors **must**{.red} [link](/guide/getting-started-guide/home-user-interface/user-profile#linking-community-forum-account) their Community Forum Account **BEFORE** editing
- Editors **must**{.red} ensure that their Discord Nickname is either the same as their IFC Username or real name
- Editors **must not**{.red} share any airport editing material or conversations (including audio) contained within the Airport Editing Discord externally (unless prior approval has been granted)
- Editors **must**{.red} be respectful to other users and practice common courtesies
- Editors **must not**{.red} use any language which, in the exclusive discretion of Infinite Flight, may be deemed offensive (including, but not limited to, language that is unlawful, threatening, vulgar, sexually explicit, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable)
- Criticism and feedback will generally be given via DM; however, on occasion, it may be provided publicly if it is deemed to be a wider issue amongst Editors
- By uploading airports using the Scenery Editor, you agree to the [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://github.com/infiniteflight/infiniteflight-localization/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)



> When uploading a new version of a recently edited airport (i.e tapping "Upload as Draft" or "Upload for Review"), Editors will be required to submit a "changelog" which highlights what has been changed in that version. Changelogs **must**{.red} be specific to ensure that it is clear what has been changed (e.g. "Adjusted C19 jetbridge. Changed taxiway line type on Taxiway A"). Additional details can be added to the IFC airport thread if required *(see [11.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/11.-review-and-release/11.1-review-and-release-process) below)* 



## Voice Channels

### 1A.2.2

- English **must**{.red} be used at all times
- The voice channels **must**{.red} only be used by members who are actively discussing editing with other Editors
- Coordination to use voice channels **must**{.red} only occur in the *#general* or *#help* Discord channels
- Editors **must not**{.red} transmit anything that may be interpreted as disruptive
- Editors **must not**{.red} transmit any private, identifying or sensitive information
- Editors **must not**{.red} impersonate another user
- Further guidance on the use of VCs can be found in Discord Communication *(see [1A.1.3](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/1a.-administration/1a.1-discord-communication#1a.1.3) above)*



### 1A.2.3

Members may contact a Staff Member or IFC Moderator at any time to report a serious violation of VC rules or an unsafe situation. Editor member safety and privacy is a top priority.

> Due to the representation of widely diverse social norms, there may be accidental utterances provoked by excitement which do not warrant moderation (e.g. mild profanity and spontaneous phrases as a result of a startling event)



## Support

### 1A.2.4

- In the first instance, Editors **should**{.red} make every effort to use the resources available to them, including this manual and fellow Editors, to seek support
- If Editors are unable to find the answer they need, they can ask for help in the *#help* Discord Channel
- The Rank Structure can be helpful to find out what the different roles in Airport Editing are, and therefore who might be appropriate to ask *(see [1A.3.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/1a.-administration/1a.3-rank-structure#1a.3.1) below)*
