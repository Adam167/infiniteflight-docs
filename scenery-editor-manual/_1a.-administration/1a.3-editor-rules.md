### 1A.3.1

- Deliberate leaks will result in access to beta, editing and potentially IFC/VA accounts being removed
- Communication about the status and review progress of specific airports, as well as issue/bug reports **must**{.red} be via the Infinite Flight Community's Scenery Editor category. The Discord server can be used for everything else
- On occasion, volunteers may be sought for specific airports to be completed, or if necessary, editors may be assigned a particular airport for completion
- There are no specific deadlines for airports, but please inform a Moderator if you are unable to complete an airport without significant delay
- The editing process is complex and so questions are encouraged however this manual **must**{.red} be read through in it's entirety before any editing is attempted



### 1A.3.3

- There are currently three types of editing, Editors **must**{.red} ensure they fall within one of these categories when editing:

  - A 2D* only edit of a non-3D airport

  - A 2D edit of a current 3D airport (with the requirement to change the 3D elements if affected by the 2D changes)

  - A 2D and 3D edit of a non-3D Airport
- Always delete OSM buildings not in the airport boundary
- Do not add vehicles or objects to road surfaces
- Keep objects and facades as realistic as possible
- Do not add objects to fill empty spaces if there are no objects shown on maps
- If a terminal is under construction in the real world and its main building sections are not yet completed, do not add it. If the building is completed but not operational, you can add it, however do not place any objects that are not present at that time. The rest of the airport can be edited as normal
- Adding custom towers **should**{.red} be avoided where possible however if you feel that it is required for the overall look of the airport, a request **must**{.red} be made beforehand for authorization
- Custom roofs **must not**{.red} have slants/curves or other highly complex structures added. You are permitted to add basic roof structures to enhance the look (so that it is not flat)
- Only one airport can be edited at a time, and other airports cannot be reserved for future work (whilst another airport is being edited)
- Do not create an IFC topic in the Scenery Editor Category for an airport that is being edited. If you are editing a new airport (or working on an existing one which does not have a thread on the IFC yet), a topic will automatically be created. Whenever new versions are uploaded, the changelogs will be added automatically to each thread so it's easy to keep track. All communication about a particular airport **must**{.red} remain within it's specific thread
- All buildings and their different layers **must**{.red} be named appropriately (i.e. "Lvl 1 Terminal 1")



**2D editing is defined as: visual fixes to lines, aprons, runways and taxiways. The creation of a taxi network or the naming and connecting of taxiways. Updating and checking airport date including, but not limited to, names, ICAO codes and frequencies*



### 1A.3.4

Custom roofs can be used to give shape and detail to terminal buildings at an airport however they **must not**{.red}:

- be used to replicate a curved roof at an airport terminal
- be excessively complex
- be used on any other section of an airport aside from the terminal areas
- use facades to give a different color to the roof top



### 1A.3.5

Fencing can be used extensively at key sections of an airport such as aprons, cargo areas and terminals to give a feeling of realism and depth to the airport, however, fencing **must not**{.red}:

- be used around an airport boundary
- be used in areas where there is little to no aircraft activity at an airport
