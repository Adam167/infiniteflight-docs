### 1A.4.1

If you are editing a new airport (or working on an existing one which does not have a thread on the IFC yet), a topic will automatically be created in the [Scenery Editor Category](https://community.infiniteflight.com/c/scenery-editing/47). Whenever new versions are uploaded, the changelogs will be added automatically to each thread so it's easy to keep track. All communication about a particular airport **must**{.red} remain within it's specific thread.
