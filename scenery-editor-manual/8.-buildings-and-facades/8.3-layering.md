# 8.3 Layering



Tip

: It is recommended to change the whole building facade to something plain (e.g. terminal 1, face 1) before starting to layer as this will make it easier for depth perception *(see [8.4.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/8.-buildings-and-facades/8.4-editing-facades#8.4.1) below)*



### 8.3.1

The below steps highlight a good method for adding detail to buildings (layering) however you may find different methods that you prefer:



Step 1

: Change the building height *(see [8.2.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/8.-buildings-and-facades/8.2-properties#8.2.1) above)*. If it is a hangar you can use the minimum hangar heights for guidance *(see [8.2.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/8.-buildings-and-facades/8.2-properties#8.2.2) above)*. For terminals or other complicated buildings, it is better to create multiple levels. Any level that is not the top floor should have the roof type set to "none" *(see [8.2.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/8.-buildings-and-facades/8.2-properties#8.2.1) above)*



Step 2

: If making multiple floors, first copy & paste the first layer of the building *(see [8.1.4](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/8.-buildings-and-facades/8.1-editing-buildings#8.1.4) above)*



Step 3

: Drag the newly copied building so that the outline is somewhere over the first layer of the original building *(see [8.1.3](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/8.-buildings-and-facades/8.1-editing-buildings#8.1.3) above)*



Step 4

: Using the management buttons on the left of the screen, tap "Object" and then "Auto Altitude". This will raise the newly copied building to make it the second layer (roof height of the first layer). You can also set the height of the building manually if needed for the same effect *(see [8.2.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/8.-buildings-and-facades/8.2-properties#8.2.1) above)*



Step 5

: Using external sources, continue to adjust the size and shapes of the layers to replicate the overall look of the building. For passenger terminals a minimum of three layers is recommended



Step 6

: With every new layer added, don't forget to name it appropriately (tap on the building > select properties > tap name to edit)



Tip

: Don't forget that you can also make layers that are a small height (no less than 1 meter), this will give you the option of changing the roof colour for example without the overall facade look changing. Editors **should**{.red} however, use the minimum amount of layers possible to achieve the most realistic look
