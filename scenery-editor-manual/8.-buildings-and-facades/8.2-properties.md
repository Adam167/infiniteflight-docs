# 8.2 Properties

### 8.2.1

Step 1

: Select the building by tapping on or near the building, you may have to select the building from a drop down list if there are multiple buildings/objects in the vicinity *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 2

: Tap the "Properties" tab **(1)** on the right side of the screen

Step 3

: You can then adjust the following properties:



| Button               | Function                                                     | Notes                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Height               | This shows the height (in meters) of the building. Tap the number and then enter in a new value to adjust this | Tools such as "3D Path" in Google Earth are a useful way to get accurate heights. In addition, buildings need to be in proportion (e.g. a hangar that you know can park a 777 inside needs to be given a height that can accommodate this - *see [8.2.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/8.-buildings-and-facades/8.2-properties#8.2.2) below*) |
| Roof Orientation     | Tap the "+/-" symbols to adjust the orientation of the roof (you can also use the "Auto Roof Orientation" button) | Building roofs have a square pattern, use this tool to get the lines to match the building edges for aesthetic purposes. You can also use the "Auto Roof Orientation" button by tapping Object > Auto Roof Orientation (this may still require manual adjustments - *see [2.1.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.2) above*) |
| Facade               | The facade group can be changed here but it will change all sides of the selected building(s) | This can be good to use if you are changing multiple buildings at the same time however you are only able to change the facade group, facade styles and individual sides of the building(s) will have to be adjusted using the other technique *(see [6.4.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/6.-buildings-and-facades/6.4-editing-facades#6.4.1) below)* |
| Roof Depth           | This shows the roof depth (in meters) of the building. Tap the number and then enter in a new value between 0 and 1 to adjust this | Adds a section of roof thats height is offset from the rest of the roof. If being used, only add to top level of buildings |
| Latitude / Longitude | Current latitude/longitude of the building                   |                                                              |
| Altitude             | This shows the current altitude (in meters) of the building. Tap the number and then enter in a new value to adjust this | The altitude is always based on the bottom of the building. You can also use "Auto Altitude" by tapping Object > Auto Altitude *(see [6.3.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/6.-buildings-and-facades/6.3-editing-buildings#6.3.2) below)* if the building is positioned on top of the building you want it to go on top of (perfect for layering!) |
| Name                 | You can name the building using this field                   | All buildings and their different layers **must**{.red} be named appropriately (i.e. "Lvl 1 Terminal 1") |



## Hangar Height

### 8.2.2

The following table outlines the minimum hangar height for aircraft within Infinite Flight:

| Aircraft        | Minimum Height Required (meters) |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| C172            | 4.5                              |
| C208/TBM-930    | 6.5                              |
| CRJ/Dash-8 Q400 | 11                               |
| A320/B737       | 18                               |
| B757            | 19                               |
| B767            | 21                               |
| A330            | 23                               |
| A350/B777       | 25                               |
| B747            | 27+                              |
