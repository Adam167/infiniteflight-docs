# 10.1 Gate Equipment Placement



When constructing your gate, please ensure that items are not overused as this can result in performance degradation as well as giving off the appearance that things may have been copy and pasted. Keep gates unique and change up the orientation of objects. 



Try to limit the repetition of certain objects within close proximity of each other. Please see quantities for each object as applicable.
