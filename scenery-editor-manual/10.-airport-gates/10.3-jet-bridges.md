# 10.3 Jet Bridges



### 10.3.1

Selection, placement and changing orientation of jet bridges is done in the same way as all other objects *(see [9.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/9.-objects/9.2-selection-and-placement) above)*.



## Properties

### 10.3.2

As well as the general properties listed above, Jet Bridges have two other sets of properties, these are "Gates" and "Animations". Animations **must not**{.red} be edited under any circumstances so only the Gate properties are listed below:

| Button               | Function                                                     | Notes                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Stowed Arm Rotation  | Tap the "+/-" symbols to adjust the orientation of the jet bridge, it is based on a default position from the base/connector and rotates counter clockwise | **Must**{.red} be adjusted to avoid collisions               |
| Stowed Arm Extension | Tap the "+/-" symbols to adjust the stowed length of the jet bridge | **Must**{.red} be adjusted to avoid collisions               |
| Stowed Head Rotation | Tap the "+/-" symbols to move the stowed head of the jet bridge | **Must**{.red} be adjusted to avoid collisions               |
| Default Height       | Tap the "+/-" symbols to adjust the default height of the jet bridge when in the stowed position | The height **must**{.red} be adjusted so that all aircraft doors that can park at that stand are reachable |
| Scale                | Tap the "+/-" symbols to adjust the scale                    | Scale **must not**{.red} be changed unless it is to revert the jet bridge to a scale of "1" (**must**{.red} be 1 for animations to work) |
| Orientation          | Tap the "+/-" symbols to adjust the orientation of the jet bridge animation range (shown as a green curved cylinder shape around the jet bridge itself) |                                                              |

> The Stowed Properties can be adjusted to ensure that the jet bridge is not in the aircraft movement area of the gate



## A380 Jet Bridge Operation

### 10.3.3

If the start location has three jet bridges, it will try to join the third jet bridge to door U1L (Upper 1 Left) of the A380. Editors **should**{.red} try to raise the base of the jet bridge *(see [9.3.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/9.-objects/9.3-properties#9.3.1) above)* as well as the default height *(see [10.3.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/10.-airport-gates/10.3-jet-bridges#10.3.2) above)* to reduce the angle of the jet bridge when connected to the aircraft door. 



### 10.3.4

To adjust the height of the base of the jet bridge, the following steps **must**{.red} be followed: 



Step 1

: Select the jet bridge base by tapping on or near the blue circle **(1)** that is in the center of the it. You can also tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to select it



Step 2

: If there are multiple objects in close proximity, a list will appear so you can select the object you want



Step 3

: Tap the "Properties" tab **(2)** on the right side of the screen and then the "+" symbol next to "Animations" **(3)**



Step 4

: A drop down list will appear, tap the "+" symbol next to "Height" **(4)**



Step 5

: This will further expand and by tapping this **(5)**, will allow you to change the height of the jet bridge base



> If the base of the jet bridge is changed, all connectors and jet bridge sections **must**{.red} also need to be adjusted to the same height *(see [10.3.5](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/10.-airport-gates/10.3-jet-bridges#10.3.5) below)*

### 10.3.5

If multiple elements of a jet bridge need their height adjusted such as a long series of jet bridge bases, connections and ends, these can be done at the same time by using the "Adjust Jet Bridge Alt" button. To do this, the following steps **must**{.red} be followed: 



Step 1

: First complete all steps shown previously *(see [10.3.4](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/10.-airport-gates/10.3-jet-bridges#10.3.4) above)*



Step 2

: Whilst the first element of the jet bridge is still selected (which has the adjusted height) - tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to select all remaining parts of the jet bridge that you want the height adjusted for (a white box will appear to show the catchment area)



Step 3

: Tap "Jet Bridge" and then "Adjust Jet Bridge Alt"



Step 4

: The height will be changed for all selected parts of the jet bridge to the same as the height of the first selected



## Jet Bridges used for both Narrow-body and Wide-body Aircraft



### 10.3.6

Editors **should**{.red} take into account the potential angle that jet bridges may be at when connected to aircraft and ensure that the base height of the jet bridge is appropriate for all aircraft types that can spawn at that start location. Below is an example of a jet bridge which has not been adjusted to accommodate narrow body aircraft.

### 10.3.7

To change this, the same process as adjusting jet bridges for the A380 **must**{.red} be followed *(see [10.3.4](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/10.-airport-gates/10.3-jet-bridges#10.3.4) above)*.
