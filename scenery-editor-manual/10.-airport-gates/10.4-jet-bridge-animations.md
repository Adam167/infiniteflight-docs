# 10.4 Jet Bridge Animations 



### 10.4.1

Once the start locations and jet bridges have been added, and the stowed positions of the jet bridges have been adjusted, Editors can move onto adding jet bridge animation. Below are the first steps that **must**{.red} be followed:



Step 1

: Check all start locations are named correctly. The following properties **must**{.red} be correct before moving onto Step 2:



| Property | Entry                                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Terminal | e.g. Concourse/Terminal/GA/Cargo/Apron/FBO etc. [name/number] |
| Name     | Gate [alphanumeric/number]*                                  |

**Editors **must**{.red} ensure that terminal names (e.g. T1) are not included in the "Name" property*



Step 2

: Tap the "Auto Assign Gates" button to bind each jet bridge to a stand



Step 3

: Above each jet bridge, it will show the start location(s) the jet bridge is assigned to (e.g. "Terminal 5/Gate 515")



Step 4

: If this is incorrect, tap the jet bridge required (if not already selected), then "Properties". Under "General" there is the "Gate" tab, tap this



Step 5

: The gates that are assigned to this jet bridge will be listed, these can be removed by tapping the "-" symbol next to it. If a gate needs to be added, enter the name of the gate by tapping the "+" symbol and then using the format "Terminal Name/Gate Name"



Step 6

: Check all start locations for jet bridges not reaching doors by tapping "Jet Bridges > Check Jet Bridges"



Step 7

: Below each start location, it will show the jet bridge status. The following color codes are used:



| Code                                              | Message                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "All Airplanes OK" - Green                        | For any start location that has a jet bridge, this **must**{.red} be the code displayed |
| "Jet Bridges [Aircraft Type* and Reason]" - Amber | Readjustment of the jet bridge is required as it is unable to reach some doors of the aircraft type(s) listed (partial) |
| "Jet Bridges [Aircraft Type* and Reason]" - Red   | Readjustment of the jet bridge is required as it is unable to reach any door of the aircraft type(s) listed |
| "No Jet Bridges Available" - Grey                 | Expected if the start location does not have a jet bridge    |

**No more than 2 aircraft types will ever be shown to avoid clutter*



Step 8

: If any start locations are not green (i.e amber or red), you **must**{.red} adjust the jet bridges to make the doors reachable *(see 10.4.2 below)*



Step 9

: Check that Airport Properties *(see [3.2.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/3.-getting-started/3.2-airport-properties#3.2.2) above)* has the "Jet Bridges Available" tick box selected (orange tick when selected) by tapping "File > Airport Properties > Jet Bridges Available"



> Jet bridges will not work in flight mode for pilots until this tick box is selected



## Adjusting Jet Bridges

### 10.4.2

Step 1

: All jet bridges **must**{.red} be checked, adjust any jet bridge that are red, amber or grey (for a start location that has a jet bridge) by first tapping "Jet Bridges" and then "Check Jet Bridges"



> Editors **must**{.red} ensure that even jet bridges that are green comply with Step 6 below



Tip

: Tap "Jet Bridges" and then "Freeze Non Jet Bridges" before attempting to move jet bridges, this freezes all other objects so you don't move something else by accident



Step 2

: Tap the end of the jet bridge **(1)**, a green curved cylinder shape will appear that shows the animation range of the jet bridge **(2)**



> The outer green curved line shows the reach of the center of the jet bridge rotation head 



Step 3

: Two circles will appear as well as a compass rose. Use the outer circle to change the orientation of the jet bridge by tapping, holding and then dragging your finger on this circle **(3)**. You can also use the "Orientation" under "Properties" *(see [9.3.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/9.-objects/9.3-properties#9.3.2) above)*. This can be moved until the green curved cylinder shape is in an area that includes the start locations

Tip

: If the jet bridge still does not reach, you can tap "Jet Bridges" and then "Use Long Jetbridge" and this may increase the range required for that start location



Step 4

: If when the jet bridge is tapped, the green curved cylinder shape is facing the wrong direction **(4)**, then tap the "Rotate Range +90" button **(5)**, this will move the jet bridge range to the correct side



![Image 8.5.2.2 - Rotate Range +90 Degrees](_images/manual/frames/7.5.2.2.png)



Step 5

: Re-tap "Jet Bridges" and then "Check Jet Bridges" and check to see that the locations are now shown in green **(6)**



![Image 8.5.2.3 - Check Jet Bridges](_images/manual/frames/7.5.2.3.png)



Step 6

: Editors **must**{.red} ensure that the green curved cylinder shape covers as much of the start location as possible **(7)**. If more of the green curved cylinder shape is in an unusable position (such as the terminal), it could limit the jet bridge range **(8)**
