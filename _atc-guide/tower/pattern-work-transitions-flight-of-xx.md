+++ SCENARIO - Re-Sequencing

::: scenario-heading
Scenario
:::

::: scenario
*I-DRUM* and *N1DC* have both already been sequenced and cleared for RWY05L. As both aircraft continue downwind, *I-DRUM* has gone further downwind than the Controller expected.

| Technique 1                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Re-clear *N1DC* as number 1                                  |
| Re-sequence *I-DRUM* as number 2                             |
| If you are concerned about separation, you can tell *I-DRUM* to "extend downwind, I'll call your base" to alleviate this |

| Technique 1       | Pro or Con?                                                |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| :fa-check-circle: | Efficient                                                  |
| :fa-check-circle: | Greater Pilot satisfaction                                 |
| :fa-times-circle: | May increase workload as you have to send various commands |

{.prosandcons}




| Technique 2                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------- |
| Instruct *I-DRUM* to "turn base"                  |
| This will force *I-DRUM* to fly a tighter pattern |

| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| :fa-check-circle: | Can be efficient                                             |
| :fa-times-circle: | Some pilots/aircraft may not be able to fly as tight a pattern |
