## Runway Changes



Manual

: If a runway change is issued, a new pattern entry and clearance **must**{.red} be given (the use of sequencing will be dependent on traffic).



| Scenario                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Aircraft 1 is departing RWY32L and Aircraft 2 is departing RWY32R. Both departures happened simultaneously. Aircraft 2 then asks for a RWY change to RWY32L |

{.scenario}

| Technique 1                                                  | Pros / Cons                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Instruct Aircraft 2 to "enter right downwind RWY32L, number 2, traffic to follow is on left downwind” | {.tick} Offers flexibility                           |
| If you are concerned about a conflict on the other end, then you can also tell aircraft 2 that you will "call their base" to alleviate this | {.cross} May cause confusion on who is following who |
| When you clear Aircraft 2, you can then give them left traffic if you wish to do so to move them onto that side for subsequent patterns |                                                      |

{.technique}

| Technique 2                                                  | Pros / Cons                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Instruct Aircraft 1 to "turn crosswind”                      | {.tick} Ensures separation between both aircraft             |
| When you are happy with the separation, simply tell Aircraft 2 to "enter left downwind for RWY32L, number 2, traffic to follow is on left downwind” | {.cross} Aircraft 2 may start the turn onto a right downwind before you have time to give the new pattern entry |
| If during this time, Aircraft 2 starts a right turn for RWY32R, then adopt Technique 1 instead |                                                              |

| Technique 3                                                  | Pros / Cons                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Instruct Aircraft 2 to "extend upwind, you'll call their crosswind” | {.tick} Prevents Aircraft 2 from entering right downwind     |
| Wait until separation between Aircraft 1 and 2 is adequate (you can expedite this by telling Aircraft 1 to "turn crosswind"), and then tell Aircraft 2 to "enter left downwind for RWY32L, number 2, traffic to follow is on left downwind” | {.cross} May add confusion when a pattern entry is used instead of "turn crosswind" |
| The new pattern entry supersedes the previous instruction    |                                                              |

Tip

: Remember that other variables (such as terrain) might influence what is the best technique to use on the day, be flexible! 





Manual

: When there is no Radar Controller present, Tower **must**{.red} issue a pattern entry and clearance to **ALL**{.red} aircraft as a **MINIMUM**{.red}, regardless of what the aircraft uses to check in on the Tower frequency - the use of sequencing will be dependent on traffic



Notes:

- how to integrate transitions into the pattern
- who should go first when you have a bunch of inbounds, how to determine that, work inside out 
- re-sequencing such as runway changes (someone extending downwind too far, and then the person behind could be re-sequences but the controller just makes them all continue)
- workload management (managing the ground and tower at the same time), ground awareness
- two aircraft at the same altitude that want a transition, how to manage
- planning, how to plan, what the pattern work altitudes will be , what altitude will people need to be at for the transition, weather limitations, over 10kts for weather etc
- runway changes
