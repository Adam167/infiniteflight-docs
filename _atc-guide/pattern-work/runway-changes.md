# Runway Changes



Manual

: If a runway change is issued, a new pattern entry and clearance **must**{.red} be given (the use of sequencing will be dependent on traffic).



| Scenario                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *VP-MAX* is departing RWY32L and *I F A E Eleven* is departing RWY32R. Both departures happened simultaneously. *I F A E Eleven* then asks for a RWY change to RWY32L |

| Technique 1                                                  | Pros / Cons                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Instruct *I F A E Eleven* to "enter right downwind RWY32L, number 2, traffic to follow is on left downwind” | {.tick} Offers flexibility                           |
| If you are concerned about a conflict on the other end, then you can also tell *I F A E Eleven* to "extend downwind, I'll call your base" to alleviate this | {.cross} May cause confusion on who is following who |
| When you clear *I F A E Eleven*, you can then give them left traffic if you wish to do so to move them onto that side for subsequent patterns |                                                      |

| Technique 2                                                  | Pros / Cons                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Instruct *VP-MAX* to "turn crosswind”                        | {.tick} Ensures separation between both aircraft             |
| When you are happy with the separation, tell *I F A E Eleven* to "enter left downwind for RWY32L, number 2, traffic to follow is on left downwind” | {.cross} *I F A E Eleven* may start the turn onto a right downwind before you have time to give the new pattern entry |
| If during this time, *I F A E Eleven* starts a right turn for RWY32R, then adopt Technique 1 instead |                                                              |

| Technique 3                                                  | Pros / Cons                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Instruct *I F A E Eleven* "extend upwind, I'll call your crosswind” | {.tick} Prevents *I F A E Eleven* from entering right downwind |
| Wait until separation between *VP-MAX* and *I F A E Eleven* is adequate (you can expedite this by telling *VP-MAX* to "turn crosswind"), and then tell *I F A E Eleven* to "enter left downwind for RWY32L, number 2, traffic to follow is on left downwind” | {.cross} May add confusion when a pattern entry is used instead of "turn crosswind" |
| The new pattern entry supersedes the previous instruction    |                                                              |

Tip

: Remember that other variables (such as terrain) might influence what is the best technique to use on the day, be flexible!
