# Multiple Inbounds



Manual

: When there is no Radar Controller present, Tower **must**{.red} issue a pattern entry and clearance to **ALL**{.red} aircraft as a **MINIMUM**{.red}, regardless of what the aircraft uses to check in on the Tower frequency - the use of sequencing will be dependent on traffic



| Scenario                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Multiple aircraft have just announced inbound but the Controller is unsure on what order to sequence them in |

| Technique 1                                                  | Pros / Cons                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Only send a pattern entry to the aircraft you are unsure about in terms of sequencing | {.tick} Offers flexibility                                   |
| Wait until the aircraft are closer, and once certain of their sequence, issue this along with their clearance | {.tick} Ensures aircraft know who they are following         |
|                                                              | {.cross} May increase workload as you have to send two separate commands |

| Technique 2                                                  | Pros / Cons                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Send a pattern entry and the most likely sequence to all aircraft | {.tick} Good for workload management                         |
| Monitor and if required, change the sequence as they get closer | {.cross} Aircraft may be unsure who they are following if the sequence is given too early |

{.technique}



Tip

: Work from the inside out by making sure that all aircraft closest to the airport have been given a pattern entry, sequence (unless they are number 1) and clearance. Then progressively work your way out to all the other aircraft!
