## Policy Principles

#### Core Principles at Infinite Flight

Infinite Flight promotes the acceptance and respect of all people. It further promotes the need for equal protection and a feeling of safety and security for all people regardless of age, social status, religion, sex, gender, race, or disability. It also aims to support those who may not fall under those social categories but consider themselves vulnerable.

Infinite Flight believes that all people have a right to self-determination and self-identity without the fear of discrimination of persecution. It believes protecting human rights, living standards, mental and physical health, and overall wellbeing is a fundamental part of any person, business, or organisation.

Infinite Flight aims to facilitate access to those who may need it, and actively promotes its online spaces as safe spaces for all users regardless of identity.
