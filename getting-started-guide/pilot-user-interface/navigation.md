# Navigation



## GPS Navigation

Once airborne, and provided you have a flight plan, GPS Navigation will be available.



Step 1

: Ensure when tapping the LNAV button that "SOURCE" is set to GPS under the Avionics tab



Step 2

: A magenta Course Select Pointer (this is the radial to your next waypoint) and Lateral Deviation Bar (indicates deviation from the required track) will appear on the [HSI](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/hud#head-up-display-(hud)). By keeping these in line, you will remain on track to your next waypoint. As you approach the waypoint on your map the flight plan will automatically cycle to the next waypoint and the Course Select Pointer will move so that you can follow the new course



Step 3

: If you engage the [Autopilot](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/autopilot#autopilot) and LNAV, the aircraft will continue to follow your flight plan



## Tuning to an ILS

@[vimeo](429403253)

Step 1

: Select the airport you want using the technique shown in ["Getting more from your Map and Mini Map"](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#getting-more-from-your-map-and-mini-map)

 

Step 2

: Cycle to the Runway tab

 

Step 3

: Tap the runway you want to tune to (it must have an ILS)

 

Step 4

: Tap "Set NAV 1". "NAV 1" will display in green by the runway to show it has been tuned successfully

Tip

: Check the "Auto tune ILS" checkbox next to "Add to FPL" when adding an ILS approach procedure to your flightplan to have the ILS for your chosen runway automatically tuned

## Displaying an ILS in your Aircraft

Step 1

: Tap "NAV" to display the Avionics tab on the Fly Screen

 

Step 2

: "NAV 1" will have the ILS frequency & ident displayed and beneath this "CRS (course) 1" will show the runway course



Step 3

: Make sure "SOURCE" is set to "NAV 1" to use it in the aircraft

 

Step 4

: The Horizontal Situation Indicator ([HSI](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/hud#head-up-display-(hud))) will display the Localizer (lateral) deviation scale and the Altitude tape will display the Glideslope (vertical) deviation scale

 

Step 4

: The course for the lateral deviation scale can be adjusted using "CRS 1" (this can be used if you wanted to fly a Back Course Localizer)

 

## Tuning to a VOR or ADF

@[vimeo](436876883)


Step 1

: Select the VOR or NDB you want using the technique shown in ["Getting more from your Map and Mini Map"](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#getting-more-from-your-map-and-mini-map)

 

Step 2

: For VORs tap "Set NAV 1" or "Set NAV 2". "Tuned to NAV 1 (or 2)" will display beneath the VOR info. For NDBs tap "Set ADF 1" and similarly, "Tuned to ADF 1" will be shown

 

## Displaying a VOR in your Aircraft

Step 1

: Once you have tuned the VOR to either NAV 1 or 2, tap "NAV" on the Fly Screen

 

Step 2

: The Avionics tab will appear, NAV 1 or 2 will have the VOR frequency and ident displayed. BRG (bearing) 1 or 2 can be changed to "NAV 1 (or 2)" and the selected needle will display this information on the Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI)

 

Step 3

: CRS (course) 1 or 2 will have 360 set by default but any radial can be selected. Provided "SOURCE" is set to "NAV 1 (or 2)", the [HSI](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/hud#head-up-display-(hud)) will display the lateral deviation scale, and the course can be adjusted to intercept and fly different radials to/from the VOR beacon

 

## Displaying an ADF in your Aircraft

@[vimeo](436902113)


Step 1

: Once you have tuned the NDB to ADF 1, tap "NAV" on the Fly Screen

 

Step 2

: The Avionics tab will appear, ADF 1 will have the NDB frequency and ident displayed. BRG (bearing) 1 or 2 can be changed to "ADF" and the selected needle will display this information on the Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI)


## Clearing a Navigation Frequency

Step 1
: Tap "NAV" on the Fly Screen

Step 2

: Tap on the frequency you wish to clear (NAV 1 / NAV 2 / ADF 1)

Step 3 

: Tap "Clear Frequency"
 

## Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS)


![TCAS on Map](_images/manual/frames/tcas.png) 


1. On both the Map and Mini Map, your aircraft is displayed with a white aircraft symbol. These symbols vary in size/shape dependent on what aircraft is being flown

   

2. Other traffic is displayed by blue aircraft

   

3. Aircraft will turn **Amber** as a Traffic Advisory (TA) Alert if the following conditions are met:

   

   -    Both aircraft are airborne with a speed above 40kts

   -    The altitude difference is less than 2000ft

   -    The other aircraft is within 40 seconds at current speed

   

4. Aircraft will turn **Red** as a Resolution Advisory (RA) Alert if the following conditions are met:

   

   -    All conditions for an TCAS TA Alert (amber) are met

   -    The altitude difference is less than 600ft

   

**Manual pilot intervention is required if a TCAS RA Alert (red) is generated, below is a table to help you know what to do:**

 

| **Example** | **Meaning**                      | **Pilot Actions**                                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ![](_images/manual/graphics/tcas-1.svg)     | The aircraft is 3000ft above you | No action required                                           |
| ![](_images/manual/graphics/tcas-2.svg)   | The aircraft is 1000ft above you | Air Traffic Controllers will ensure 3 miles  lateral or 1000ft vertical separation at all times. No action required |
| ![](_images/manual/graphics/tcas-3.svg)    | The aircraft is 800ft below you  | Aircraft separation is close to being broken  - if under active ATC, request deviation if no instructions given |
| ![](_images/manual/graphics/tcas-4.svg)      | The aircraft is 100ft below you  | With or without active ATC – smoothly adjust  your flight path to avoid the aircraft, if they are below you we recommend  climbing, if they are above, we recommend descending |

 

Tip

: The minimum aircraft separation that you must maintain at all times is 3nm of each other laterally, or 1000ft vertically. When under active ATC, they will ensure this separation is maintained. In busy airspace it is common to see lots of Amber aircraft symbols - don’t overreact, just keep a good eye on your mini map whilst flying!
