1. The camera symbol allows you to select between numerous angles

   

Step 1

: To change the camera angle, either tap the camera symbol, or press and hold for more options

Step 2

: When you press and hold, an option box will appear above the camera symbol, and the current selection will have a solid orange box next to it

Step 3

: There are 7 different categories and within these, multiple options that can be chosen. Whilst continuing to hold your finger on the screen, slide between the categories, and then between the different options within the category. A hollow orange box will move, and once you have highlighted the option you want displayed, release your finger



Tip

: Once you have the desired camera selected, you can use your finger to move the camera around, or a pinching motion with two fingers to zoom in/out. With the [Free Cams](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/cameras#operating-the-drone-camera) (i.e. Free and Exterior/Interior Drone 1/2), you can use the left side of the screen to go left/right or zoom in/out; and the right hand side of the screen to move the direction the camera is facing
