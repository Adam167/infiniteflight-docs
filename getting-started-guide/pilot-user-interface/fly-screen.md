# Fly Screen

![Fly Screen](_images/manual/frames/hud-screen-1.png)



Let&#39;s get you ready to fly! Welcome to the screen you'll see once you've [calibrated your device](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/calibration#calibration). Below is a breakdown of everything on the screen:



1. This is the [Head Up Display (HUD)](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/hud#head-up-display-(hud)) and shows all the major information such as speed, altitude and aircraft attitude 

   

2. The [Mini Map](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#mini-map) is a great tool to be able to see your surroundings without leaving the main screen to check your flight plan

   

3. A headset icon is shown if you&#39;re on one of the live servers, you'll be able to [talk to the Air Traffic Controllers using this button](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/communication#communication)

   

4. The mini map can be used to make a [flight plan](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning), but if you want more detail and a view of the whole Earth, this can be used instead

   

5. The [Status Bar](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/status-bar#status-bar) at the bottom of the screen can provide loads of information which is fully customizable so that you can choose what you want to see

   

6. The [camera symbol](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/cameras#camera) can be used to change the view whilst using the app 

   

7. Tapping this symbol will take you to the [pause menu](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/pause-menu) where you can edit settings, recalibrate your device, edit weight &amp; balance, and adjust time/weather/position (dependent on if you are in Fly Solo or Fly Online mode)

   

   Tip

   : Try to avoid [pausing](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/pause-menu#pause-menu) for too long whilst on the live servers, you may be paused but your aircraft will continue in real time! 

   

8. The [Ground Services](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/ground-services) button contains any applicable services that can be provided to the aircraft such as pushback and connecting jet bridges

  

8. The [Systems](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/systems#systems) button contains miscellaneous actions such as opening doors, electrics, lights, signs and engine start

   

9. The [Navigation](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/navigation#navigation) button contains the avionics where the course and source for navigating using NAV 1 &amp; 2, GPS, VOR/ADF and ILS can be selected

   

10. The [Autopilot](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/autopilot#autopilot) button contains the Flight Control Unit (FCU) functions where the Autopilot and Navigation can be turned on/off, bugging Altitude and Heading, and setting Vertical Speed (VS) and Speed

    

11. Primary [Flight Controls](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) are controlled by the physical movement of your device using the accelerometer, with the exception of the rudder/brakes which are located in the bottom right of the screen. The Parking Brake and Trim are available as buttons on the screen for all aircraft, as well as the Landing Gear, Flaps and Spoilers if fitted

    

    Tip

    : Make sure your device is [calibrated](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/calibration#calibration) and the sensitivity is adjusted to suit you!
