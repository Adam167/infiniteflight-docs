Step 1

: To open the ground services menu tap the "Ground Services" button



Step 2

: Within the menu there are various options that can be selected. Services that are selected will be highlighted orange



> For ground services to be used the aircraft must be parked at a stand that is large enough for that aircraft type, the parking brake set and the engines and beacon set to off. Pushback is only possible when all other ground services are deselected (provided the aircraft is capable of pushback)



Step 3

: There may be other menus within the ground service tab available. To change this, press and hold the "Ground Services" button. An option box will appear next to the ground service menu. The current ground service will have a solid orange box next to it



Step 4

: There can be up to 2 different ground service menus, but the options available vary dependent on the aircraft variant. Whilst continuing to hold your finger on the screen, slide between the ground services in the option box. A hollow orange box will move, and once you have highlighted the system you want displayed, release your finger
