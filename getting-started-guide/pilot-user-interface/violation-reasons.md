# Violation Reasons



Below is a complete list of all the reasons that can be used by Controllers when issuing a Pilot with a [Violation](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/violations). Not sure what Violations are? A brief summary is below but more information can be found on our dedicated [Violation](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/violations) page:



Level 1 Violation

: If a pilot receives 3 or more Level 1 Violations in one flight, they will automatically be removed from the server and will have to start a flight again



Level 2 Violation (Amber)

: The pilot is disconnected from the server but can continue the flight offline. The pilot may return to the Expert Server immediately by starting a new flight provided the number of Level 2 and 3 Violations remain under the server allowed limits



Level 3 Violation (Red)

: The pilot is disconnected from the server but can continue the flight offline. The pilot will not be able to return to the Expert Server after the flight has been ended, with access being restricted for 7 days following this



Tip

: This page should help you identify the reason why you received a violation, however they are sometimes generic and the specific circumstances to your situation may not be listed. Still not sure, why not try and [contact the controller directly](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/violations#appealing-a-level-2-or-3-violation) on our Community Forum?



## Aligned with the Wrong Runway

*Issued by: Radar*

*Violation Level: 2*



Situational awareness whilst flying is an important aspect that pilots must maintain to enjoy a realistic experience on the Expert Server. Not maintaining appropriate separation with other aircraft, not following sequencing, excessive speed, incorrect arrival procedures, alignment with or landing/departing from the wrong runway; can all result in removal from the Expert Server.



## Blocking an Active Taxiway

*Issued by: Ground*

*Violation Level: 2*



Ground awareness is an essential part of any flight, therefore you must ensure that you have clearance to taxi or cross/enter runways (if ATC is active), and under all circumstances, check it is clear. Do not taxi through grass or terminal areas, block active taxiways or get too close to other aircraft.

## Crossing the Hold Line without Permission

*Issued by: Ground/Tower*

*Violation Level: 2*



Ground awareness is an essential part of any flight, therefore you must ensure that you have clearance to taxi or cross/enter runways (if ATC is active), and under all circumstances, check it is clear. Do not taxi through grass or terminal areas, block active taxiways or get too close to other aircraft.

## Excessive Speed in the Airport Environment

*Issued by: Tower/Radar*

*Violation Level: 3*



Situational awareness whilst flying is an important aspect that pilots must maintain to enjoy a realistic experience on the Expert Server. Not maintaining appropriate separation with other aircraft, not following sequencing, excessive speed, incorrect arrival procedures, alignment with or landing/departing from the wrong runway; can all result in removal from the Expert Server.



+++ Fighter Aircraft Etiquette

There is currently no system limit on speeds for fighter aircraft, however a reasonable speed should always be maintained when in a controlled airspace, whether tower or approach. As a general rule 250-300kts should never be exceeded when under the control of ATC.



The following are a good rule of thumb and the *recommended* military aircraft parameters:

- Do not exceed M1.0 in normal flight
- Do not exceed 300KIAS under ATC control or in a congested airspace
- Do not exceed 250KIAS within 15 miles of the landing airport



Instructions, sequence, and traffic volume should **always** dictate your speed and cause increased awareness of your surroundings.

The Expert Server can be incredibly busy, Controllers will always try to give the best and most expeditious service possible, however; there may be occasions where patience is required. This is particularly important during events, peak times and/or at the most popular airports. Therefore, Pilots must avoid sending duplicate requests when possible as this may be treated as spamming the frequency.
