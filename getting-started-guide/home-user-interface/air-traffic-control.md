# Air Traffic Control



![ATC Page](_images/manual/frames/air-traffic-control-page-232.png)



1. Select the [World](/guide/getting-started-guide/home-user-interface/air-traffic-control#world) you would like to control in (Training Server, or Expert Server)

      

2. The search function allows you to find the airport you want with ease. If you know the ICAO four letter code (e.g. KSFO for San Francisco Intl.) then you can type some or all of this, and a list of options will appear. Alternatively, just type in some or all of the city/airport name

   â€‹    

3. You can also use the map to find your chosen airport. Just use your finger to navigate around the globe, a pinching motion to zoom in and out, and then tap on the airport you want

     

4. Airports that have buildings added are marked with a "3D" symbol

   

5. Red cones indicate an ILS onto that runway, white cones indicate any other approach type available

    

6. A card is displayed on the right of your device with all the information relevant to your selected airport including:

   - Traffic inbound count
   - Expected duration you plan to control for
   - Available frequencies
   - Any other controllers that are active at this airport
   - Weather

   

## Frequency Selection

Once you have chosen the airport, you can use the card to select the frequencies that you want to control.



![Frequency Selection](_images/manual/frames/frequency-selection-232.png)



1. Tap on a frequency to select it. Selected frequencies are indicated by an amber ring around the frequency

    

2. Frequencies highlighted in green are already in use by another controller

    

3. If other controllers are present at the airport, the current services available are highlighted in green, as well as the ATIS if published

    

4. You can select the duration you plan on controlling for here (you can exit anytime but should try to control for at least the duration selected)

    

5. The airport symbol on the map will have a colored dot in the centre to indicate what the weather is like:

   | Indication                                  | Meaning                      |
   | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
   | ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-vfr.png)  | Visual Flight Rules          |
   | ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-mvfr.png) | Marginal Visual Flight Rules |
   | ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-ifr.png)  | Instrument Flight Rules      |

   

7. Runway color codes help you know where the wind is coming from and to assist in determining which runways should be used:

   | Indication                                    | Meaning                                                      |
   | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-green.png)  | Headwind above 3kts (or wind from any direction when under 3kts) - runway recommended |
   | ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-orange.png) | Crosswind above 3kts                                         |
   | ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-red.png)    | Tailwind above 3kts - runway not recommended                 |

   

8. Ready to control? Tap on the [Control button](/guide/getting-started-guide/atc-user-interface/ground-tower-radar) to begin
