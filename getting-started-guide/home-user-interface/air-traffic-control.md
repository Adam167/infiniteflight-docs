# Air Traffic Control



![ATC Page](_images/manual/frames/air-traffic-control-page-232.png)



1. Select the [World](/guide/getting-started-guide/home-user-interface/air-traffic-control#worlds) you would like to control in (Training Server, or Expert Server)

  ​    

2. The search function allows you to find the airport you want with ease. If you know the ICAO four letter code (e.g. KSFO for San Francisco Intl.) then you can type some or all of this, and a list of options will appear. Alternatively, just type in some or all of the city/airport name

  ​    

3. You can also use the map to find your chosen airport. Just use your finger to navigate around the globe, a pinching motion to zoom in and out, and then tap on the airport you want

     

4. Airports that have buildings added are marked with a "3D" symbol

   

5. Red cones indicate an ILS onto that runway, white cones indicate any other approach type available

    

6. A card is displayed on the right of your device with all the information relevant to your selected airport including:

   - Traffic inbound count
   - Expected duration you plan to control for
   - Available frequencies
   - Any other controllers that are active at this airport
   - Weather

   

## Frequency Selection

Once you have chosen the airport, you can use the card to select the frequencies that you want to control.



![Frequency Selection](_images/manual/frames/frequency-selection-232.png)



1. Tap on a frequency to select it. Selected frequencies are indicated by an amber ring around the frequency

    

2. Frequencies highlighted in green are already in use by another controller

    

3. If other controllers are present at the airport, the current services available are highlighted in green, as well as the ATIS if published

    

4. You can select the duration you plan on controlling for here (you can exit anytime but should try to control for at least the duration selected)

    

5. The airport symbol on the map will have a colored dot in the centre to indicate what the weather is like:

   | Indication                                  | Meaning                      |
   | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
   | ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-vfr.png)  | Visual Flight Rules          |
   | ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-mvfr.png) | Marginal Visual Flight Rules |
   | ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-ifr.png)  | Instrument Flight Rules      |

   

7. Runway color codes help you know where the wind is coming from and to assist in determining which runways should be used:

   | Indication                                    | Meaning                                                      |
   | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-green.png)  | Headwind above 3kts (or wind from any direction when under 3kts) - runway recommended |
   | ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-orange.png) | Crosswind above 3kts                                         |
   | ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-red.png)    | Tailwind above 3kts - runway not recommended                 |

   

8. Ready to control? Tap on the [Control button](/guide/getting-started-guide/atc-user-interface/ground-tower-radar) to begin

   


## Worlds

The various live servers available to use are displayed here. Each server has its own set of rules and minimum grade requirements, make sure to check these before trying to join!



![ATC Worlds](_images/manual/frames/atc-worlds-232.png)



| Server   | Description                                                  | Minimum [Grade](/guide/getting-started-guide/home-user-interface/user-profile#the-grade-table) |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Training | This server is used to practice pilot and ATC skills. All ATC facilities (except ATIS) can be accessed and procedures are enforced by [Violations](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/violations#violations) | 2                                                            |
| Expert*  | This is a server where published rules must be adhered to. All procedures are strictly enforced by ATC. Infractions may result in issued [Violations](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/violations#violations) | 3**                                                          |

**In order to be able to control on the Expert server, you must undergo formal training - more information can be found on the [Infinite Flight Community Forum](https://community.infiniteflight.com/t/infinite-flight-atc-recruiting/564656)*

***In addition to the minimum grade requirement, the number of total Level 1 Violations must be at least 50% less than the number of total landings and pilots may not have [5 or more Level 2 or 3 Violations in the last 365 days](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/violations#what-happens-if-i-get-a-violation%3F)*
