# Air Traffic Control

![Air Traffic Control](_images/manual/frames/air-traffic-control-227.png)

1. Pick your frequencies using the [Station Selection button](#station-selection)

   

2. There are various servers for different experiences, select the [Server button](/guide/getting-started-guide/home-user-interface/air-traffic-control#server) to pick the best fit for you (note that the Expert Server has restricted access for controlling)

   

3. The [Airspace Status](/guide/getting-started-guide/atc-user-interface/status#status) table helps show you how many aircraft are inbound to a particular airport and if it has active ATC. You can tap the refresh button to make sure it’s up to date before you decide where to control

   

4. Ready to go control? Tap on the [Control button](/guide/getting-started-guide/atc-user-interface/ground-tower-radar#ground%2C-tower-%26-radar) to begin

 

## Station Selection

Selecting frequencies is very similar to selecting an airport and parking position if you were about to fly. The globe is displayed in the same way, and you can either use the features below to choose where to begin, or zoom in with your fingers!

1. The search function allows you to find the airport you want with ease. If you know the ICAO four letter code (e.g. KSFO for San Francisco Intl.) then you can type some or all of this, and a list of options will appear. Alternatively, just type in some or all of the city/airport name

   

2. Blue dots signify airports that have a tower facility (although it may not necessarily have active ATC). We also use a variety of colors to give you an idea of what the weather is like. Check out the table below:

    | Indication                                  | Meaning                      |
    | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |

    | ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-mvfr.png) | Marginal Visual Flight Rules |
    | ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-ifr.png)  | Instrument Flight Rules      |



3. Magenta dots signify uncontrolled airports. The same colors as the blue dots are used to show weather. Check out the table above

   

4. Zoomed in too much? No problem, just tap "Reset Zoom" if you want to zoom out again

   

5. Runway color codes help you know where the wind is coming from. However, as the controller you’ll need to pick the runways taking into account the airport taxiway layout, where traffic currently is located, what the weather is like now, and what the weather is forecast to become. Check out the table below:

    | Indication                                    | Meaning                                                      |
    | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-green.png)  | Headwind above 3kts (or wind from any direction when under 3kts) - runway recommended |
    | ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-orange.png) | Crosswind above 3kts                                         |
    | ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-red.png)    | Tailwind above 3kts - runway not recommended                 |
    
     
    
    Tip
    
    : Aircraft like to take-off and land into wind, try to pick the runways with a headwind if you can!
    
    
    
6. You can select one or more frequencies to control, and dependent on the server, controller qualifications might affect what you can control too

    

## Worlds

The various live servers available to use are displayed here. Each server has its own set of rules and minimum grade requirements, make sure to check these before trying to join!

| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Solo     | Choose your own aircraft and route, test your piloting skills and explore beautiful scenery without rules or other pilots | N/A                                                          |

| Training | This server is used to practice pilot and ATC skills. All ATC facilities (except ATIS) can be accessed and procedures are enforced by [Violations](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/violations#violations) | 2                                                            |
| Expert   | This is a server where published rules must be adhered to. All procedures are strictly enforced by ATC. Infractions may result in issued [Violations](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/violations#violations) | 3*                                                           |

**In addition to the minimum grade requirement, the number of total Level 1 Violations must be at least 50% less than the number of total landings and pilots may not have [5 or more Level 2 or 3 Violations in the last 365 days](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/violations#what-happens-if-i-get-a-violation%3F)*
