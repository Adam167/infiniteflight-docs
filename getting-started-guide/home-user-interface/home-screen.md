1. In the top right hand corner you’ll find the "Get Pro" subscription button. If you already have a subscription, then your [User Profile](/guide/getting-started-guide/home-user-interface/user-profile) will show instead

   

2. [Solo mode](/guide/getting-started-guide/home-user-interface/fly-solo#fly-solo) is offline (no internet connection required), allowing you to practice without anyone else around, in weather conditions of your choosing

   

3. [Fly Online](/guide/getting-started-guide/home-user-interface/fly-online#fly-online) is home to our three live servers which allow you to choose the experience you want, but with some company too 

   

4. Don’t want to fly? Here you can [control](/guide/getting-started-guide/home-user-interface/air-traffic-control#air-traffic-control) aircraft on our live servers instead

   

5. Our default settings are sure to get you going, but if you want to, you can [customize your experience](/guide/getting-started-guide/home-user-interface/settings#settings)

   

6. Rookie or professional, our [User Guide](/guide) is here to help any experience level

   

7. All of your controlling sessions and flights are recorded and stored in [Replays](/guide/getting-started-guide/home-user-interface/replays#replays) for when you want to look back

   

8. As well as replays, all information is automatically logged when you fly or control so that you can keep track [in the Logbook](/guide-guide/getting-started/home-user-interface/logbook#logbook)

   

9. Subscribe to our social media pages and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/infiniteflightapp) to stay up to date with the latest Infinite Flight news
