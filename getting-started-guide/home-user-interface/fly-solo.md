## Aircraft Selection

There are loads of different aircraft and liveries to choose from, maybe it’s your favorite airline, or the aircraft you just completed your Private Pilots License in, the choices are endless! Below is a break down of how to select your next aircraft.

![Aircraft Page](_images/manual/frames/aircraft-page.png)



1. The various airline manufacturers are displayed on the left side, such as Airbus and Boeing

   

2. Under each manufacturer, there is a list of aircraft types that you can scroll through

   

3. Once you have tapped on the aircraft you want to fly, you can select what livery you would like using the dropdown list in the top right of the screen

   

4. Infinite Flight has been in constant development, and some of our earlier aircraft aren't the same standard as the latest aircraft in our fleet. If this box is ticked, all of our aircraft (including older, legacy aircraft) are shown on your list

   

5. If you have re-installed the app or paid for a Pro Subscription, tap "Restore Purchases" to make sure you have all of your purchased aircraft available for download

 

## Airport and Gate Selection

The entire globe is ready for you to explore, you can either use the features below to choose where to begin, or zoom in with your fingers!

![Map Zoomed Out](_images/manual/frames/map-zoomed-out.png)

 

1. The search function allows you to find the airport you want with ease. If you know the ICAO four letter code (e.g. KSFO for San Francisco Intl.) then you can type some or all of this, and a list of options will appear. Alternatively, just type in some or all of the city/airport name

   

2. Blue dots signify airports that have a tower facility (although it may not necessarily have active ATC)

 

3. Magenta dots signify uncontrolled airports

4. Zoomed in too much? No problem, just tap "Reset Zoom" if you want to zoom out again

   

5. Runway color codes help you know where the wind is coming from and which runways are "most likely" in use. But watch out, sometimes controllers will be using a different runway than you’re expecting, make sure to look out for traffic! Check out the table below:

    | Indication                                                 | Meaning                                                      |
    | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-green.png)   | Headwind above 3kts (or wind from any direction when under 3kts) - runway recommended |
    | ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-orange.png) | Crosswind above 3kts                                         |
    | ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-red.png)       | Tailwind above 3kts - runway not recommended                 |

    

6. In solo mode you can park wherever you want, but in online mode all parking positions are size restricted. If the parking positions are red, you’re too big

    

    Tip

    : Select the aircraft you want to fly before selecting a parking position, then you’ll be able to see where you can and can’t park

    

7. Once you’ve decided on your spawn point, you’ll be able to see what airport and gate has been selected in the bottom right hand corner
