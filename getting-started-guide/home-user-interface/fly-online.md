1. The search function allows you to find the airport you want with ease. If you know the ICAO four letter code (e.g. KSFO for San Francisco Intl.) then you can type some or all of this, and a list of options will appear. Alternatively, just type in some or all of the city/airport name

    

2. Blue dots signify airports that have a tower facility (although it may not necessarily have active ATC)

 

3. Magenta dots signify uncontrolled airports

4. Zoomed in too much? No problem, just tap "Reset Zoom" if you want to zoom out again

    

5. Runway color codes help you know where the wind is coming from and which runways are "most likely" in use. But watch out, sometimes controllers will be using a different runway than you’re expecting, make sure to look out for traffic! Check out the table below:

   | Indication                                    | Meaning                                                      |
   | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-green.png)  | Headwind above 3kts (or wind from any direction when under 3kts) - runway recommended |
   | ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-orange.png) | Crosswind above 3kts                                         |
   | ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-red.png)    | Tailwind above 3kts - runway not recommended                 |

   

6. In solo mode you can park wherever you want, but in online mode all parking positions are size restricted. If the parking positions are red, you’re too big

     

   Tip

   : Select the aircraft you want to fly before selecting a parking position, then you’ll be able to see where you can and can’t park

   

7. Once you’ve decided on your spawn point, you’ll be able to see what airport and gate has been selected in the bottom right hand corner
