# NDB (Non-Directional Beacon) Approach



## What is an NDB Approach?

NDB Approaches can be flown in Infinite Flight using the techniques shown here, however ATC are currently unable to support these approach requests - for now, we recommend finding an uncontrolled airport or quiet area to practise in!



Tip

: Make sure to check out our [NDB Navigation](/guide/flying-guide/take-off-to-cruise/ndb-(non-directional-beacon)-navigation#ndb-(non-directional-beacon)-navigation) page to get to grips with the basics before flying an NDB Approach!



## How do I fly an NDB Approach?



Step 1

: En-route to your destination, check the weather to determine the best runway for arrival - once you have done this, check the approach chart for that runway, and if it has an NDB Approach, you can start to set up for this approach



Step 2

: Ensure that you have [tuned](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#tuning-to-a-vor-or-adf) the required NDB for the approach and display it by setting "BRG 1 (or 2)" to ADF



Step 3

: [Intercept the radials](/guide/flying-guide/take-off-to-cruise/ndb-(non-directional-beacon)-navigation#how-to-navigate-using-an-ndb) at the correct distance/altitude as per your chart and always think of the "next event" to stay ahead of the aircraft



Tip

: Feel overloaded? Reduce your workload by engaging the [Autopilot](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/autopilot#autopilot) and using Heading and V/S to follow the profile instead of manual flying



Step 4

: Continue to monitor both your lateral and vertical deviation and make the adjustments required to keep these centralized. At the appropriate point, based on speed control by ATC and the recommended profile for your aircraft type; continue to configure to meet the Stability Approach Criteria



## What is the Stability Approach Criteria (SAC)?

The Stability Approach Criteria (SAC) is there to access if you have flown a stable approach, and whether to continue to land or go-around.



All approaches must meet the SAC by 1000ft AGL (above ground level). The SAC are:



- In the planned landing configuration
- Stabilized on the correct vertical profile
- Stabilized at the target approach speed




If any of the SAC are not met, a [go-around](/guide/flying-guide/descent-to-landing/go-around-baulked-landing#go-around%2Fbaulked-landing) must be flown.



Once your final configuration has been selected and you have decelerated to your target approach speed, we recommend remaining  within the following tolerances in order to access your stability:



| Parameter          | Tolerance                                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Speed              | Target Approach Speed -5/+10 kts                           |
| Vertical Speed     | No more than 1000ft/min*                                   |
| Pitch              | No more than -2.5 degrees nose down or +10 degrees nose up |
| Bank               | Angle not exceeding 7 degrees                              |
| Lateral Navigation | No more than 1 dot of lateral deviation                    |

**Environmental conditions such as a tailwind, or a steeper than usual flight path angle could increase the descent rate required to more than 1000ft/min*
