# Holding



## What is a Hold?

The primary purposes of a hold are to provide separation and flow control to aircraft during the arrival sequence usually in a localized area close to the destination airport. Holds are generally organized around a navigation aid (NAVAID) such as a VOR or NDB. All procedures are drawn using magnetic tracks (not headings) and each leg should take 1 minute in still air (1:30 above 14,000ft/FL140) unless otherwise specified on the chart.

The abeam indication is the point at which the timing of the outbound leg commences (regardless of wings level). For a conventional VOR hold (i.e. the Course Pointer aligned to the hold axis), the abeam indication is when the 'TO/FROM' pointer first reverts to indicating 'TO'. With a single Bearing pointer (VOR or ADF hold), the correct indication of the abeam position is when the Bearing Pointer is indicating 90 degrees to the hold axis.



In still air, at one minute from abeam, the relative bearing from the beacon will be about 30 degrees from the reciprocal of the hold axis (e.g. if the hold axis is 270 degrees, the reciprocal is 090 degrees and the gate bearing is therefore 060 degrees). This is referred to as the 'Gate'.



Tip

: If the length of the hold is greater than 1 minute (in still air), the gate relative bearing of 30 degrees is no longer valid! 



## Hold Entries

There are three types of hold entries, these are:

 

 -    Direct

 -    Parallel

 -    Teardrop

 

If an aircraft is approaching a hold from the direct entry side as shown in the image *(see 6.7.6.1 below)*, Controllers can expect the aircraft to go ‘direct’ to the origin of the hold and then fly the standard holding pattern from there. For a parallel entry, a flight path similar to the blue line below can be expected before the standard holding pattern is flown. And finally, for the teardrop entry, a flight path similar to the red line.

## What is the Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI)?

The Horizontal Situation Indicator or HSI, is the primary instrument used for navigation in Infinite Flight. It consists of the following elements:



- Compass rose orientated with the current aircraft heading
- Blue heading bug displaying the [Autopilot FCU](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/autopilot#autopilot) bugged heading
- Single blue pointer to represent BRG (bearing) 1 - when tuned to a navigation source (ILS, VOR or NDB) it will point to the navigation aid
- Double blue pointer to represent BRG (bearing) 2 - when tuned to a navigation source (ILS, VOR or NDB) it will point to the navigation aid
- Course Deviation Indicator (CDI) made up of the Course Pointer and Lateral Deviation Bar - displayed in magenta for GPS, and light green for NAV 1 and NAV 2

## How to Set Up your Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI)

Step 1

: [Tune the NAVAID](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#tuning-to-a-vor-or-adf) by tapping the NAVAID from your [Map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#map) or [Mini Map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#mini-map), selecting the VOR/NDB from the list displayed, and then tap "Set NAV 1 (or 2)"



Step 2

: [Display the VOR](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#displaying-a-vor-in-your-aircraft) or [NDB](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#displaying-an-adf-in-your-aircraft) by tapping "NAV" on the Fly Screen to show the Avionics tab, and ensure that either BRG 1 (or 2) have NAV 1 (or 2) or ADF displayed (dependent on which NAVAID you tuned)



Step 3

: If you have used a VOR you can utilize the Course Deviation Indicator (CDI) by opening the Avionics tab. Change the "SOURCE" to NAV 1 (or 2) as required, and then adjust the respective course (CRS 1 or 2) to the desired magnetic bearing that you want to fly



## How to Set Up for the Hold



Step 1

: Determine which hold that you are going to fly by looking at the chart, from this you will need to know what NAVAID to use, what the Inbound Hold Axis is, and how long the Inbound/Outbound legs will be (if this is not shown it is assumed to be 1 minute in still air below 14,000ft/FL140)



Step 2

: Set up your HSI



Step 3

: Determine which direction you will be entering the hold from and therefore what Hold Entry needs to be flown (i.e. Direct, Parallel or Teardrop)



Tip

: If you have been assigned a hold by ATC, it may not be a hold that is published on a chart that you are using; if this is the case, simply follow the magenta line displayed on your map or mini map as this will help you navigate the ATC assigned hold



## How to Enter the Hold



**Parallel Entry**



[INSERT PARALLEL ENTRY IMAGE]



Step 1

: When crossing the holding fix, fly a track that is parallel to the hold axis for 1 minute (in still air)



Step 2

: Next, begin a turn in towards the hold, keep the turn going until the Bearing Pointer has past the aircraft nose by approximately 15 degrees



Step 3

: As the aircraft approaches the Inbound Hold Axis, the bearing pointer will begin to fall away from the aircraft nose providing a steep intercept angle. To manage this, turn a few degrees towards the Bearing Pointer so that the intercept angle is approximately 20 degrees



Step 4

: Continue this process until the Bearing Pointer is within 10 degrees of the Inbound Hold Axis, at his point, intercept the Inbound Hold Axis



**Offset Entry** 



[INSERT OFFSET ENTRY IMAGE]



Step 1

: On reaching the holding fix, turn the aircraft onto a heading that will allow it to intercept a radial that is 30 degrees offset from the reciprocal of the Inbound Hold Axis



Step 2

: 



**Direct Entry**



[INSERT DIRECT ENTRY IMAGE]



Step 1

: Dependant on the angle at which the aircraft approaches the holding fix, you will need to hold that heading for period of time before continuing the turn to enter the hold
