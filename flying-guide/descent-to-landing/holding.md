# Holding



Tip

: When referring to headings, the reciprocal is simply the opposite heading (i.e. 180 degrees in the other direction) - so the reciprocal of 270 degrees is 090 degrees!



## What is a Hold?

The primary purposes of a hold are to provide separation and flow control to aircraft during the arrival sequence in a localized area close to the destination airport. Holds are generally organized around a navigation aid (NAVAID) such as a VOR or NDB. All procedures are drawn using magnetic tracks (not headings) and each leg should take 1 minute in still air (1:30 above 14,000ft/FL140) unless otherwise specified on the chart.



Tip

: A hold consists of four legs - these are the inbound and outbound legs, and the turns at each end! 



![Image 6.7.4.1 - Standard Holding Pattern](_images/manual/graphics/atc-standard-hold.jpg)



The abeam indication is the point at which the timing of the outbound leg commences (regardless of whether the wings are level or not). The correct indication of the abeam position is when the Bearing Pointer is indicating 90 degrees to the hold axis (for a VOR/NDB hold).



## Hold Entries

There are three types of hold entries, these are:

 

 -    [Direct](/guide/flying-guide/descent-to-landing/holding#how-to-enter-the-hold)

 -    [Parallel](/guide/flying-guide/descent-to-landing/holding#how-to-enter-the-hold)

 -    [Teardrop](/guide/flying-guide/descent-to-landing/holding#how-to-enter-the-hold)



If an aircraft is approaching a hold from the direct entry side as shown in the image *(see 6.7.6.1 below)*, you should plan to go "direct" to the origin of the hold and then fly the standard holding pattern from there. For a parallel entry, a flight path similar to the blue line below should be followed before the standard holding pattern is flown. And finally, for the teardrop entry, a flight path similar to the red line.

## What is the Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI)?

The Horizontal Situation Indicator or HSI, is the primary instrument used for navigation in Infinite Flight. It consists of the following elements:



- Compass rose orientated with the current aircraft heading
- Blue heading bug displaying the [Autopilot FCU](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/autopilot#autopilot) bugged heading
- Single blue pointer to represent BRG (bearing) 1 - when tuned to a navigation source (ILS, VOR or NDB) it will point to the navigation aid
- Double blue pointer to represent BRG (bearing) 2 - when tuned to a navigation source (ILS, VOR or NDB) it will point to the navigation aid
- Course Deviation Indicator (CDI) made up of the Course Pointer and Lateral Deviation Bar - displayed in magenta for GPS, and light green for NAV 1 and NAV 2

![HSI Elements](_images/manual/graphics/hsi-elements.jpg)



## How to Set Up your Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI)

Step 1

: [Tune the NAVAID](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#tuning-to-a-vor-or-adf) by tapping the NAVAID from your [Map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#map) or [Mini Map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#mini-map), selecting the VOR/NDB from the list displayed, and then tap "Set NAV 1 (or 2)"



Step 2

: [Display the VOR](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#displaying-a-vor-in-your-aircraft) or [NDB](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#displaying-an-adf-in-your-aircraft) by tapping "NAV" on the Fly Screen to show the Avionics tab, and ensure that either BRG 1 (or 2) have NAV 1 (or 2) or ADF displayed (dependent on which NAVAID you tuned)



Step 3

: If you have used a VOR you can utilize the Course Deviation Indicator (CDI) by opening the Avionics tab. Change the "SOURCE" to NAV 1 (or 2) as required, and then adjust the respective course (CRS 1 or 2) to the desired magnetic bearing that you want to fly



Tip

: If you do decide to use the CDI, we recommend setting the Inbound Hold Axis!



## How to Set Up for the Hold



Step 1

: Determine which hold that you are going to fly by looking at the chart, from this you will need to know what NAVAID to use, what the Inbound Hold Axis is, and how long the Inbound/Outbound legs will be (if this is not shown it is assumed to be 1 minute in still air below 14,000ft/FL140)



Step 2

: [Set up your HSI](/guide/flying-guide/descent-to-landing/holding#how-to-set-up-your-horizontal-situation-indicator-(hsi))



Step 3

: Determine which direction you will be entering the hold from and therefore what [Hold Entry](/guide/flying-guide/descent-to-landing/holding#hold-entries) needs to be flown (i.e. Direct, Parallel or Teardrop)



Tip

: If you have been assigned a hold by ATC, it may not be a hold that is published on a chart that you are using; if this is the case, simply follow the magenta line displayed on your map or mini map as this will help you navigate the ATC assigned hold



## How to Enter the Hold



Tip

: As you get closer to a NAVAID in the hold, the sensitivity will increase. Therefore if you are really close, try not to chase the Bearing Pointer! 



+++ Parallel Entry


![Parallel Entry](_images/manual/graphics/parallel-hold-entry.jpg)



Step 1

: When crossing the holding fix, make a slight turn to fly a track on the non-holding side that is parallel to the hold axis for 1 minute (in still air)



Tip

: If it is a right-hand hold, this will mean making a left turn to fly parallel. If it is a left-hand hold, a right turn will be needed



Step 2

: Next, begin a turn in towards the hold (it will be in the same direction as the previous turn), keep the turn going until the Bearing Pointer has past the aircraft nose by approximately 15 degrees



![Intercept Inbound Hold Axis - Parallel](_images/manual/frames/intercept-inbound-hold-axis.png)



Step 3

: As the aircraft approaches the Inbound Hold Axis, the bearing pointer will begin to 'fall away' from the aircraft nose providing a steep intercept angle. To manage this, turn a few degrees towards the Bearing Pointer so that the intercept angle is approximately 20 degrees



Step 4

: Continue this process until the Bearing Pointer is within 10 degrees of the Inbound Hold Axis, at his point, intercept the Inbound Hold Axis



Step 5

: Once overhead the holding fix, start the left/right turn and fly the normal holding pattern

+++



+++ Teardrop Entry


![Teardrop Entry](_images/manual/graphics/teardrop-hold-entry.jpg)



Step 1

: On reaching the holding fix, turn the aircraft onto a heading that will allow it to intercept a radial that is 30 degrees offset from the reciprocal of the Inbound Hold Axis



Tip

: So if the Inbound Hold Axis is 270 degrees, the reciprocal is 090 degrees. 30 degrees offset would be 060 degrees for a right-hand hold, and 120 degrees for a left-hand hold



Step 2

: Fly this radial for 1 minute (in still air) before beginning a turn in towards the hold (right turn for a right-hand hold and left turn for a left-hand hold) 



![Offset Heading](_images/manual/frames/offset-heading.png)



Step 3

: Keep the turn going until the aircraft heading is within 30 degrees of the Inbound Hold Axis



![Intercept Inbound Hold Axis - Teardrop](_images/manual/frames/intercept-inbound-hold-axis-2.png)



Step 4

: As the aircraft approaches the Inbound Hold Axis, the bearing pointer will begin to 'fall away' from the aircraft nose providing a steep intercept angle. To manage this, turn a few degrees towards the Bearing Pointer so that the intercept angle is approximately 20 degrees



Step 5

: Continue this process until the Bearing Pointer is within 10 degrees of the Inbound Hold Axis, at his point, intercept the Inbound Hold Axis



Step 6

: Once overhead the holding fix, start the left/right turn and fly the normal holding pattern

+++



+++ Direct Entry

Step 1

: The Direct Entry is the easiest way in which to join the hold. The normal holding pattern can be flown as soon as you have overflown the Holding Fix



Step 2

: If when joining, the aircraft is approaching the Holding Fix at a "steep" angle (e.g. more than 30 degrees either side of the Inbound Holding Axis), you may need to adjust your initial turn for the Outbound Leg to compensate for this. Below is an example of what may be required: 




![Direct Entry](_images/manual/graphics/direct-hold-entry.jpg)



| Aircraft | Action Required                                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1        | Cross the Holding Fix and turn into the hold. At 90 degrees to the axis, roll out for 15 seconds before recommencing the turn into the hold |
| 2        | Cross the Holding Fix and turn into the hold. At 90 degrees to the axis, roll out for 5 seconds before recommencing the turn into the hold |
| 3        | Cross the Holding Fix and turn into the hold                 |
| 4        | Cross the Holding Fix, wait 5 seconds and then turn into the hold |
| 5        | Cross the Holding Fix, wait 10 seconds and then turn into the hold |
| 6        | Cross the Holding Fix, wait 15 seconds and then turn into the hold |

## Recommended Speeds

We recommend not exceeding the following speeds when flying holds:



| Altitude (MSL)                           | Airspeed (KIAS) |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Minimum Holding Altitude (MHA) to 6000ft | 200             |
| 6001ft to 14000ft                        | 230             |
| 14,001ft and above                       | 265             |
