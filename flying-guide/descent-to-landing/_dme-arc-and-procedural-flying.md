# DME Arc and Procedural Flying



## What is a DME Arc?

A DME (Distance Measuring Equipment) Arc is a curved route defined by a constant distance from a navigation facility that contains a DME. The arc distance from the beacon is essentially a radius of the arc circle. These are commonly used as an initial approach segment procedure to enter directly onto the intermediate part of the approach, to enter a hold or to help to route to a distance defined turn point on an airway

Start of arc is defined by a radial from a VOR or a bearing from an NDB. Round the arc are radials and bearings that permit further descent to be made, and can also be used for position awareness. The final radial or bearing is known as the lead radial or lead bearing and is the one that aircraft may turn to intercept the final approach track.



Entering the Arc

Usually entering an arc is by following a radial or bearing and approaching the arc at a 90 degree angle. Therefore a 90 degree turn will require anticipation, a general rule of thumb is 1% of groundspeed, so if you are flying 180kts, you will need to start the turn at 1.8 miles to go



Flying the Arc

Once established on the arc, to follow the curved track and keep the DME distance the same. At any point on the curve, not taking wind into account, the aircraft heading must always be 90 degrees to the beacon. However to fly this and match the radius of turn requires the aircraft to adopt an angle of bank which would vary depending on the rand from the DME. Clearly, this is impractical. Instead, the aircraft makes a series of heading changes, cutting slightly across the arc each time. As already stated, the heading should be 90 degrees to the radial or bearing from the beacon, but by taking a cut across the arc, the aircraft flies along the base of a series of isosceles triangles with the length of the triangle being the radius of the arc.

If the aircraft turns left 10 degrees for the next cut-across, the bearing pointer will then read 5 degrees above the left 90 degrees line (actual 85 degrees relative bearing) and as it reaches the arc again the bearing pointer will have dropped to 5 degrees below to 90 degrees relative bearing line (actual 95 degrees relative bearing). This pattern helps to control the heading



Control of heading

Knowledge of what heading to turn onto on first joining the arc helps to set the initial arc. Thereafter, the heading does not need to be calculated as the RMI bearing pointer provides a pictorial method to control the heading from which to provide a 'command' heading to fly during each cut-across.



 

## What is the Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI)?

The Horizontal Situation Indicator or HSI, is the primary instrument used for navigation in Infinite Flight. It consists of the following elements:



- Compass rose orientated with the current aircraft heading
- Blue heading bug displaying the [Autopilot FCU](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/autopilot#autopilot) bugged heading
- Single blue pointer to represent BRG (bearing) 1 - when tuned to a navigation source (ILS, VOR or NDB) it will point to the navigation aid
- Double blue pointer to represent BRG (bearing) 2 - when tuned to a navigation source (ILS, VOR or NDB) it will point to the navigation aid
- Course Deviation Indicator (CDI) made up of the Course Pointer and Lateral Deviation Bar - displayed in magenta for GPS, and light green for NAV 1 and NAV 2

## How to Set Up your Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI)

Step 1

: [Tune the VOR](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#tuning-to-a-vor-or-adf) by tapping the VOR from your [Map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#map) or [Mini Map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#mini-map), selecting the VOR from the list displayed, and then tap "Set NAV 1 (or 2)"



Step 2

: [Display the VOR](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#displaying-a-vor-in-your-aircraft) by tapping "NAV" on the Fly Screen to show the Avionics tab, and ensure that either BRG 1 (or 2) have NAV 1 (or 2) displayed (dependent on which NAV you tuned the VOR to)



Step 3

: Lastly, within the Avionics tab, make sure to change the "SOURCE" to NAV 1 (or 2) as required, and then adjust the respective course (CRS 1 or 2) to the desired magnetic bearing that you want to fly











This tutorial will be using the ILS Y RWY 4R at PHNL ~ Daniel K. Inouye International Airport *(aka Honolulu International Airport)*



ILS 4R Approach Plate

Prior to starting an approach with a DME Arc, you‚Äôll first need to figure out a few things:

- What the VOR in use is
- Where the Arc starts
- And how far from the VOR the arc is

Once you have established these three things, you‚Äôll proceed to tuning in the appropriate navigation frequencies needed to complete the intended approach.

------

Circled below you‚Äôll find that I‚Äôve circled in pink some information. Included in this circle is some helpful information:

- **3000**. This represents the altitude that this arc needs to be flown at
- **HNL:** This is the VOR that you need to have tuned in
- **13.9 Arc:** This is the distance from the VOR that needs to be maintained to accurately fly this approach.



**Step 1:**- Tune in the ILS into NAV1 or NAV2 *(If applicable)* *(Important note: not all runways will have an ILS)*

- Do not adjust CRS. Doing so will mess up your alignment with the runway and could off set you from the runway
  *see ‚ÄúRunway CRS Alignment‚Äù for when you should adjust the ILS course*

**Step 2:-** Tune in the VOR that you will be using for the approach. In this case we‚Äôre using the ***HNL VOR***. Put this in the other NAV you‚Äôre not using for the ILS.

**Step 2 ¬Ω:-** For planning purpose, I would give you the option put in the approach waypoints in your flight plan. In my images and video near the end of this tutorial, you‚Äôll find that I‚Äôve added my waypoints on the approach into my flight plan. I did not use these to navigate but to reference where I was at on the approach. Just a helpful tip. üôÇ

**Step 3:-** Determine where the DME Arc starts. If you refer to the ILS Y 4R approach plate, you‚Äôll note that this approach starts at **ALANA (IAF)** *IAF = Initial Approach Fix - A fix where all approaches will start*

**Step 4:-** You‚Äôre just about to get to **ALANA.** It‚Äôs important to ensure that you‚Äôre at an appropriate speed for your aircraft. The aircraft needs to be stable. You do not want to be trying to slow the aircraft down, adjusting flaps, extending gear, etc while in the middle of the Arc. Get your flaps set, set your speed, set your altitude, and focus on flying the DME Arc. Once you turn onto final, only then can you proceed with lowering your gear, adjusting your speed, and lowering the remaining of your flaps *(if applicable)*

**Step 5:-** You‚Äôre all set. You‚Äôve taken the previous steps into account and now you‚Äôre on your way to fly the Arc. As noted in step 2 ¬Ω I‚Äôve got a FPL set. I am not following it intentionally. As noted before, I‚Äôve got the FPL there to reference where I‚Äôm at on the approach. Because Infinite Flight does not depict DME Arcs on our map, this will show as a straight line.

**Step 6:-** Refer to **(DME Arc Image 1)** for this step. There are a few things to note in this image.

- NAV 1 is tuned into the ILS for 04R
- NAV 2 is tuned into the HNL VOR
- The upper most information block here is my source. This shows that my NAV 2 is active and being depicted on my heading indicator. This is what is depicting my large green needle (Course Deviation Indicator ‚ÄúCDI‚Äù)
- The blue needles are called RMI (Radio Magnetic Indicator). You cannot adjust these with the controls you have. The only way to change these are to tune into a new VOR or change your heading.

**Step 7:-** Refer to **(DME Arc Image 2)** for this step. After you‚Äôve noted the various components needed in Step 6, Step 7 has one tiny little feature to note, yet plays a crucial role in making this DME Arc turn out how it should. In this image, you‚Äôll note that there is a little line/dot to the right of the heading indicator. For reference its aligned with the heading mark 005Àö.

- When flying your DME Arc, you need to use this line as a ‚Äú90Àö mark‚Äù as a marker to keep a constant and consistent turn going in a way that I‚Äôll explain next.

**Step 8:-** Using your RMI needle for your VOR, allow the needle to drop below this 90Àö mark by about 5-10 degrees. In the video below, you‚Äôll notice that I was using 5 degrees to show that this arc is not a straight line.

- *Because the HNL VOR and the ILS for 04R were in line with each other, it may appear I‚Äôm using the ILS RMI on NAV 1 when turning. This was not the case. Important to note that some airports may have the VOR and your ILS location on different locations of the airport.*

After you‚Äôve allowed the needle to drop 5-10 degrees, its time to turn 5-10 degrees to the right in our example; the same amount you let the needle drop. Keep in mind the approach you‚Äôre doing may require a turn to the left.

You‚Äôve been flying this DME Arc using your RMI needles. You will need to keep repeating this process until your CDI is within 10 degrees of the 90Àö line. *(Refer to Step 6 & Step 7 for information about the CDI and the 90Àö line)*

**Step 9:-** You‚Äôre within 10-15 degrees of your final approach course and your CDI is within 10-15 degrees of the 90Àö line. You will need to change your NAV Source so that you can now drive/fly off of the ILS now. A little bit of multitasking may be required here. At the same time, you need to start your turn to a 30 degree intercept to the final approach course.

- In our example with 04R our final approach course is 042Àö. For a 30Àö intercept we will need to fly from the arc to a heading of 012Àö to meet this 30 degree intercept. This will come quick so be prepared as you‚Äôre about to catch the localizer any moment!

**Step 10:-** You‚Äôre about to capture the localizer, you‚Äôre at 3000ft and looking good. Right on profile. As you continue your turn to align with the runway, you‚Äôll need to hold this 3000ft altitude until your glideslope comes down to the point where you can follow it down to the runway.

- For aircraft with retractable gear, this would also be the point where you would lower your gear, and add any remaining flaps that would be required to make a safe and successful landing.

*To finish it off, lay down a greaser or execute a go around and go for an attempt #2*





# Runway Course Alignment

If on a visual day where you can see the runway, and you notice that you are not aligned with the runway properly, you may need to adjust the course of the ILS so that you are on centerline.

### Why?

The charts that you may be using, and the charts that were used to build the airport you‚Äôre flying into may differ slightly when developed. 1 degree may be the difference between you landing on a taxiway and landing on your runway. In my video included in this tutorial, you‚Äôll see that 042, the final approach course was not correct, but rather 043 was correct. Its small things like this that we as pilots need to be cautious of when approaching runways. Utilizing our map will help ensure that we‚Äôre not aligned on the wrong runway.
