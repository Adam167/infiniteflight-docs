# Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR) Navigation


## What is a STAR?

Standard Terminal Arrival Routes, known as STARs, are a published flight procedure that are followed by aircraft on an IFR flight plan from an intermediate altitude. STARs allow aircraft to arrive following a pre-defined route (and in some cases with altitude/speed restrictions) that help them navigate adjacent airspaces, terrain and departing traffic. 



## What is a Transition?

"Transition" is a word commonly used in aviation and youâ€™re probably already familiar with requesting this with a Tower facility to transition through their airspace. A Transition when used with reference to SID/STARs refers to a branch of the procedure that will break you off in the direction of your destination. Not all procedures will have a transition but do keep an eye out for them as they will be beneficial when wanting a more direct routing.



## How do I put a STAR into my Flight Plan?

Step 1

: En-route to your destination, check the ATIS/D-ATIS for runway(s) and ATC preferred STAR(s) in use. You should try to pick an ATC preferred STAR and transition that starts in roughly the direction you are approaching from



Tip

: It is common to be given vectors and/or altitude assignments during the approach, make sure to follow these - ATC instructions supersede your Flight Plan!



Step 2

: Load the STAR into your flight plan by following our step by step guide [here](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/navigation#selecting-departure%2C-arrival-and-approach-procedures)



Step 3

: It's possible you may be given a different runway to what you were expecting and therefore might need to change your STAR, be prepared and have a few options in case this happens 



## How do I fly a STAR?

Step 1

: Now that your flight plan is loaded, we can utilize the [GPS Navigation](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/navigation#gps-navigation) to navigate the STAR



Step 2

: Study your flight plan and/or charts, and if you wish, you can also tune any [navigation aids](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/navigation#navigation) used on the STAR for extra guidance. Make sure to follow all altitude/speed restrictions, this is crucial to observe airspace restrictions, ensure terrain clearance and to maintain separation with other traffic



Step 3

: When approaching your Top of Descent (TOD) with active ATC, you should request descent. The Controller will either approve descent via the STAR or instruct you to expect vectors if this is not possible. Don't forget that ATC instructions supersede your flight plan so make sure to follow them! They will let you know when it is clear to "Continue as Filed"



Step 4

: To follow the STAR, ensure that the magenta Radial Deviation Bar is inline with the magenta Course Select Pointer on your HSI



Tip

: Before making any turns, check surroundings to make sure it is clear, use the [Cameras](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/cameras#camera) and [Mini Map](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#mini-map) to help you



Step 5

: As you approach the waypoint, the flight plan will automatically cycle to the next waypoint and your HSI will be reset with a new radial to follow



Step 6

: Feel overloaded? Reduce your workload by engaging the [Autopilot](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/autopilot#autopilot) and LNAV mode to get your aircraft to follow the flight plan for you



Tip

: Use caution when arming LNAV if the autopilot is engaged, the aircraft will immediately start to follow your flight plan - make sure it is clear first!
