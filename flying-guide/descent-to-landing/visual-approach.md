# Visual Approach



## What is a Visual Approach?

A visual approach is an approach to a runway conducted under [IFR](/guide/flying-guide/take-off-to-cruise/instrument-flight-rules-(ifr)-en-route-navigation#instrument-flight-rules-(ifr)-en-route-navigation) but where the pilot proceeds by visual reference when cleared to do so. This means that the pilot must be visual before the Controller can clear the aircraft for the visual approach.



There are multiple ways in which a visual approach can be given to the pilot but generally speaking, and terrain permitting; Radar Controllers will position the pilot in a recognizable position such as downwind, base, or even straight in. The pilot will then be asked to "report the airfield in sight", and once this has been confirmed the pilot will be cleared for the approach and handed over to Tower/Unicom as appropriate. 



Tip

: For a realistic experience why not try and find the approach plate for the airport you intend on flying into and give it a go?



## How do I fly a Visual Approach?

Step 1

: En-route to your destination, check the ATIS/D-ATIS for runway(s) in use



Tip

: It is common to be given vectors and/or altitude assignments during the approach, make sure to follow these - ATC instructions supersede your Flight Plan!



Step 2

: When contacting the Radar Controller, request the Visual approach for the runway in use



Tip

: Traffic permitting this will be granted but be prepared for a different approach in case they can't accommodate it!



Step 4

: The Radar Controller will issue vectors and/or altitude assignments to get you into position and then ask for you to 'report the airport in site' - use the [Cameras](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/cameras#camera) and [Mini Map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#mini-map) to help you locate the airport



Tip

: Feel overloaded? Reduce your workload by engaging the [Autopilot](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/autopilot#autopilot)!



Step 5

: Once you're visual, let the Radar Controller know and they will clear you for the approach. Once cleared, you can continue flying visually to the runway threshold for landing and will be handed over to Tower/Unicom when appropriate



Step 6

: Continue to monitor both your lateral and vertical profile and make adjustments as required. At the appropriate point, based on speed control by ATC and the recommended profile for your aircraft type; continue to configure to meet the Stability Approach Criteria



## What is the Stability Approach Criteria (SAC)?

The Stability Approach Criteria (SAC) is there to access if you have flown a stable approach, and whether to continue to land or go-around.



All approaches must meet the SAC by 1000ft AGL (above ground level). The SAC are:



- In the planned landing configuration
- Stabilized on the correct vertical profile
- Stabilized at the target approach speed



If any of the SAC are not met, a [go-around](/guide/flying-guide/descent-to-landing/go-around-baulked-landing#go-around%2Fbaulked-landing) must be flown.



Once your final configuration has been selected and you have decelerated to your target approach speed, we recommend remaining within the following tolerances in order to access your stability:



| Parameter      | Tolerance                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Speed          | Target Approach Speed -5/+10 kts         |
| Vertical Speed | No more than 1000ft/min*                 |
| Pitch          | No more than -2.5 degrees nose down or +10 degrees nose up |
| Bank           | Angle not exceeding 7 degrees (once aligned** with the extended centerline) |

**Environmental conditions such as a tailwind, or a steeper than usual flight path angle could increase the descent rate required to more than 1000ft/min*

***Some airports may require low level turns to align with the runway*
