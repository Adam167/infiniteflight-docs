# Go-Around/Baulked Landing



@[vimeo](411493331)



## What is a Go-Around?



A Go-Around (G/A) is an aborted landing by an aircraft on final approach and can either be initiated by the pilot or ATC.



Possible reasons to Go-Around can include:



- An unstable approach (both pilot induced or due to environental factors)
- Landing or intersecting runway blocked by another aircraft
- Or loss of separation with the aircraft ahead



It is important to note that the responsibilty for a go-around lies equally with the pilot and the controller, if ATC is present. Therefore if you're not happy with your final approach, the conditions, or a potential loss of separation, anticipate a go-around and then promptly initiate it if required.



## How to perform a Go-Around



To perform a Go-Around, following the steps below, take note that step 1 to 3 are normally commenced symmultaneously:



Step 1

: Set Take-Off/Go-Around (TOGA) thrust



Tip

: TOGA thrust can vary significantly with weight, altitude and temperature all playing a part. If you're light and at sea level, you might not need more than 90% N1; if you're heavy and at 5000ft above sea level, you may need all the power you can get!



Step 2

: Retract flaps to a take-off setting



Step 3

: Pitch for 15 degrees nose up



Tip

: Once you have stabilised the climb, monitor your speed and then adjust pitch to maintain. Your target speed is either VAPP (Final Approach Speed) or the speed at which you initiated a Go-Around, whichever is higher



Step 4

: Positive Climb? Gear Up!



Step 5

: Initally maintain runway heading unless you have been instructed to fly a particular heading



Tip

: You should always fly to the end of the departure runway before turning, unless you have been instructed to fly a heading by ATC. You may need to offset and fly on one side of the runway if another aircraft is currently on the take-off roll



Step 6

: Tell ATC you are initiating a Go-Around or acknowledge the instruction to Go-Around



Tip

: Always **AVIATE** - **NAVIGATE** - **COMMUNICATE**, and in that order! If ATC are present they will know that you won't respond straight away, so concentrate on the flying first, then navigate and communicate



## What is the difference between a Go-Around and a Baulked Landing?



Until you select reverse thrust, it is never too late to initiate a Go-Around, even if you have already touched down! A Go-Around is often referred to as a Baulked Landing when you are very close to the ground and touchdown is likely during the process of a Go-Around. 



For a Baulked Landing follow the same step by step guide as a Go-Around, with the one exception that you should delay setting take-off flaps until you are climbing away from the runway.
