# Global Positioning System (GPS) Approach



## What is a GPS Approach?

The Global Positioning System (GPS) Approach is defined by a series of waypoints and altitude restrictions that the pilot will follow to the runway threshold, free of conventional guidance such as a localizer/glideslope etc. The GPS Approach is a non-precision approach within Infinite Flight but is not commonly used as functionality is currently limited. The different types of GPS Approaches that you can select can be found [here](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#selecting-departure%2C-arrival-and-approach-procedures).



## How do I fly a GPS Approach?

Step 1

: En-route to your destination, check the ATIS/D-ATIS for runway(s) in use



Tip

: It is common to be given vectors and/or altitude assignments during the approach, make sure to follow these - ATC instructions supersede your Flight Plan!



Step 2

: Make sure that a GPS approach has been selected by following our step by step guide [here](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#selecting-departure%2C-arrival-and-approach-procedures)



Step 3

: If you have been vectored off of your flight plan, Radar Controllers will ensure that you are instructed to 'Continue as Filed' before issuing a clearance for the approach. Utilize your [GPS Navigation](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#gps-navigation) to follow your flight plan and approach



Tip

: Feel overloaded? Reduce your workload by engaging the [Autopilot](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/autopilot#autopilot) and using both [LNAV](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#gps-navigation) and [VNAV](/guide/flying-guide/descent-to-landing/vertical-navigation-(vnav)#vertical-navigation-(vnav)) for navigation, the aircraft will automatically follow the approach



Step 5

: To follow the GPS Approach manually, ensure that the magenta Lateral Deviation Bar is inline with the magenta Course Select Pointer on your HSI. Once this is within 1 dot of lateral deviation, you are established - when no conflict exists, you will then be handed over to Tower from Radar (if ATC is active), do not change frequency without permission!



Tip

: VNAV will only work up to the last altitude restriction in your flight plan. After this, you will need to take over manually!



Step 7

: Continue to monitor both your lateral and vertical deviation and make the adjustments required to keep these centralized. At the appropriate point, based on speed control by ATC and the recommended profile for your aircraft type; continue to configure to meet the Stability Approach Criteria



## What is the Stability Approach Criteria (SAC)?

The Stability Approach Criteria (SAC) is there to access if you have flown a stable approach, and whether to continue to land or go-around.



All approaches must meet the SAC by 1000ft AGL (above ground level). The SAC are:



- In the planned landing configuration
- Stabilized on the correct vertical profile
- Stabilized at the target approach speed



If any of the SAC are not met, a [go-around](/guide/flying-guide/descent-to-landing/go-around-baulked-landing#go-around%2Fbaulked-landing) must be flown.



Once your final configuration has been selected and you have decelerated to your target approach speed, we recommend remaining within the following tolerances in order to access your stability:



| Parameter          | Tolerance                                |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Speed              | Target Approach Speed -5/+10 kts         |
| Vertical Speed     | No more than 1000ft/min*                 |
| Pitch              | No more than -2.5 degrees nose down or +10 degrees nose up |
| Bank               | Angle not exceeding 7 degrees            |
| Lateral Navigation | No more than 1 dot of lateral deviation  |

**Environmental conditions such as a tailwind, or a steeper than usual flight path angle could increase the descent rate required to more than 1000ft/min*
