# Taxi to Parking and Shutdown



## Taxi to Parking

Step 1

: Once you have exited the runway, access the [Systems](https://infiniteflight.com/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/systems#systems) menu and select the following:



| LIGHTS  |         |
| ------- | ------- |
| Strobes | **OFF** |
| Land    | **OFF** |

{.checklist} 



Step 2

: Provided you have clearance to do so, switch to the Ground frequency and [request taxi to parking](https://infiniteflight.com/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/communication#communication), or if there is no active ATC, announce taxi on the Unicom frequency – listen out whilst you’re on the move for other traffic



Tip

: When you exit the runway, do not stop and keep moving unless this would cause a collision! You have the right of way and you may cause a conflict with traffic taking-off/landing behind you if you do stop



Step 3

: Retract [flaps](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) and select [spoilers](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) to **OFF**. Access the [Systems](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/systems#systems) menu and select the following:



| Electrical |           |
| ---------- | --------- |
| APU*       | **START** |

{.checklist}



*If fitted – not all aircraft are currently equipped with an APU



Step 4

: Continue to check surroundings to make sure it is clear, use the [Cameras](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/cameras#camera) and [Mini Map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#mini-map) to help you

 

Tip

:   We recommend you do not exceed 40% N1 whilst taxiing, and once you’ve started to move, you typically don’t need more than idle power!

 

Step 5

: Use the [Rudder](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) to maintain the taxiway centerline and either the [Rud Brakes or Park Brake](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) to keep your speed under control

 

Tip

:   Do not exceed 35kts groundspeed to avoid in game violations, we recommend you keep your speed below 25kts in a straight line and 10kts or less during 90° turns for a safe operation.

 

Step 6

: If you need to cross a runway whilst taxiing, make sure to [request runway crossing](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/communication#communication) with the active ATC, or if there is no active ATC, announce crossing on the Unicom frequency – always check it’s clear before you enter the runway! Don’t forget to access the [Systems](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/systems#systems) menu and select the following:

 

| Lights  |        |
| ------- | ------ |
| Strobes | **ON** |
| Land    | **ON** |

{.checklist}

 

Once you’re clear of the runway, you can turn these lights back to **OFF**.

 

## Shutdown

Step 1

: Make sure that the stand or parking spot that you intend on parking in is big enough for your aircraft type, you can use online tools in advance to help you



Step 2

: Use the [Rudder](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) to maintain the taxiway centerline and either the [Rud Brakes or Park Brake](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) to keep your speed under control



Step 3

: Reduce groundspeed to under 10kts and use the oversteer technique if you are a large aircraft to align your aircraft with the centerline as you turn onto the stand or parking spot



Step 4

: Once you have reached the parking position, set the [Park Brake](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls). Access the [Systems](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/systems#systems) menu and select the following:

 

| Engines         |         |
| --------------- | ------- |
| Eng ‘X’ 'X'% N1 | **TAP** |

{.checklist}



| Lights |         |
| ------ | ------- |
| Beacon | **OFF** |

{.checklist}




| Passengers |         |
| ---------- | ------- |
| Seat Belts | **OFF** |
