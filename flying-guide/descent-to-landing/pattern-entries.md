# Pattern Entries



## Types of Pattern Entries

There are numerous ways to enter the traffic pattern, however ATC instructions (if present) for pattern entry will always supersede these.



The most common technique (if you are on the side of the traffic pattern), is to enter at a 45 degee angle to the downwind leg, headed toward a point abeam the midpoint of the runway to be used for landing.



If you are on the opposite side of the traffic pattern then there are a couple of options available, these are:



- cross over midfield at least 500 feet above pattern altitude (1500ft or 2000ft AAL depending on what aircraft types are in the pattern). When clear of the pattern, scan carefully for traffic, descend to pattern altitude and then turn right to enter at 45 degrees to the downwind leg at midfield like the method outlined above
- or enter on a midfield crosswind at pattern altitude, carefully scan for traffic and then turn downwind (we recommend not using this technique if the traffic pattern is busy)



## How to enter the Traffic Pattern



Step 1

: En-route to your destination, check the ATIS/D-ATIS for runway(s) in use and if pattern work is being accepted at this time



Tip

: If pattern work is currently not allowed, you can still join for a landing or touch & go, however you will not be able to continue with further patterns following this



Step 2

: If ATC is active, call inbound and announce your intentions, the Tower Controller will issue you with a pattern entry instruction. If it is Unicom, you can request traffic advisories



Tip

: If no ATC is present, it is the pilots responsibility to determine runway(s) in use, traffic pattern direction and to show courtesy towards other traffic already in the pattern. Always check your surroundings to make sure it is clear, use the [Cameras](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/cameras#camera) and [Mini Map](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#mini-map) to help you



Step 3

: The traffic pattern is normally entered at a 45 degree angle to the downwind leg, headed toward a point abeam the midpoint of the runway to be used for landing (however you may also be instructed to enter base or straight in if ATC is present)

Step 4

: Always enter the traffic pattern at the correct altitude. In Infinite Flight the pattern altitude is 1000ft AAL (above aerodrome level) for prop aircraft, and 1500ft AAL for jet aircraft



Tip

: Remember to give way to aircraft already established in the pattern (or follow the sequencing given by ATC if different). In either case, always announce your intentions, monitor the other traffic and adjust your speed to fit into the traffic pattern



## Departing the Traffic Pattern

If departing the traffic pattern, the pilot should continue beyond the departure end, climbing to the pattern altitude (or higher) before either:



- continuing straight out
- exiting with a 45 degree turn (to the left when in a left-hand traffic pattern; to the right when in a right-hand traffic pattern)
- or following your flight plan



Tip

: Make sure to always tell ATC (if present) what you are doing. If you have been told to climb straight ahead to a certain altitude, make sure you are at or above this and that it is completly clear of other traffic before making any turn!
