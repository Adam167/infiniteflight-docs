# Crosswind/Tailwind Landing



## Crosswind Landing

There are two techniques that can be used in a crosswind landing. The 'Crab' method which is usually preferred by airliners, and the 'Wing Low' method, usually the technique of choice for light General Aviation aircraft.



**Crab Technique**

Step 1

: Utilize the [ATIS](/guide/flying-guide/on-the-ground/flight-planning#atis) and other weather information to determine the direction of the wind and crosswind component. Before commencement of the approach, be sure to know which direction the wind is coming from



Step 2

: To perform a crosswind landing using the crab method, offset the aircraft heading (nose into wind) so that the aircraft is tracking the runway centerline (so if the wind is coming from the right, you will need to have the aircraft nose pointing to the right of the runway)



Tip

: Use the Flight Path Vector (the green circle displayed on the [HUD](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/hud#head-up-display-(hud)) when airborne), commonly referred to as 'The Bird', to help you. If the FPV is placed on the runway centerline, your aircraft will be tracking it



Step 3

: After the flare, and just before touchdown; gently use the [rudder](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) to align the aircraft nose with the runway centerline



Step 4

: In strong crosswinds, you may need to simultaneously lower the into wind wing to maintain the centerline until touchdown (so if the wind is coming from the right, tilt your device to the right so that the right [aileron](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) is up, and the left aileron is down)



Tip

: For independent control of your ailerons and rudder, make sure that auto-coordination is turned **OFF** in your Settings



Step 5

: Use the [rudder](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) to maintain the runway centerline. As speed decreases, so does the aerodynamic affect of the rudder, more input will be required at slower speeds



**Wing Low Technique**

Step 1

: Utilize the [ATIS](/guide/flying-guide/on-the-ground/flight-planning#atis) and other weather information to determine the direction of the wind and crosswind component. Before commencement of the approach, be sure to know which direction the wind is coming from



Step 2

: To perform a crosswind landing using the wing low method, lower the into wind wing (so if the wind is coming from the right, tilt your device to the right so that the right [aileron](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) is up, and the left aileron is down). Simultaneously, use the [rudder](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) to keep the aircraft nose aligned with the runway centerline



Tip

: For independent control of your ailerons and rudder, make sure that auto-coordination is turned **OFF** in your Settings



Step 3

: During the flare, airspeed will decrease, and therefore so will the aerodynamic affect of the flight controls. More [rudder](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) and [aileron](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) input will be required



Step 4

: During the touchdown, and just before the nose gear is lowered; you may need to relax the [rudder](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) inputs to prevent the aircraft from veering off in the direction of the increased rudder deflection used during the flare



Step 5

: Use the [rudder](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) and into wind [aileron](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) to maintain the runway centerline - more input will be required at slower speeds



## Tailwind Landing



Where possible you should always try to land into wind, so try and pick the runway with the best headwind component. However, if an airport is busy, or if the weather means that there is no favorable runway, you may find that you have to land with a tailwind.  The landing is very similar to a normal or crosswind landing, but we have three extra tips to help you do this successfully:



Tip

: The flare height may need to be slightly higher than normal to account for the higher groundspeed



Tip

: We recommend that you do not land if the tailwind component exceeds 10kts



Tip

: Be more cautious during the flare and avoid 'floating' down the runway, a tail strike is more likely with a tailwind
