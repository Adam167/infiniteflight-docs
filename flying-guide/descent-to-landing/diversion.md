# Diversion



## What is a Diversion?

A diversion is when the aircraft is no longer able to continue to the original destination, and is now diverting to a new airport. The list of reasons as to why a diversion is initiated is endless but some of the most common reasons in Infinite Flight could be:



- The destination airport is full and no longer receiving inbound aircraft
- There are long delays at the destination airport and you no longer have enough fuel to wait for an approach 



## Considerations for a Diversion

Below is a table of the various factors that should be taken into account before initiating a diversion:



| Factors             | Considerations                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Fuel                | Do you have enough fuel to get there?                        |
| Weather             | Is the weather suitable for an approach and landing? What type of approaches are available? |
| Route               | Is there terrain or airspace that you need to be aware of en-route? |
| Airport Facility    | Are the taxiways, aprons and parking spaces suitable for the size of your aircraft? |
| Landing Performance | Is the runway long enough for you to land safely?            |



To help reduce your workload during a diversion, there are things that you can do to be prepared:



Step 1

: Before departure, make sure to check alternate airports that are close to your destination and look if they meed the criteria above



Step 2

: Make sure to have a minimum of one alternate selected and load the fuel required for this



Step 3

: If you are expecting the destination airport to be busy, load more fuel! 



Tip

: By preparing in advance, you will be able to make an informed decision and divert much more quickly! 



## How to Initiate a Diversion



Step 1

: Make sure the alternate airport meets the [considerations for a diversion](/guide/flying-guide/descent-to-landing/diversion#considerations-for-a-diversion)



Step 2

: Communicate with ATC of your intention to divert by [selecting a new service such as an approach request for the new airport](/guide/flying-guide/atc-communication/descent-and-approach#pilot-to-radar-controller-communication-table) (or if you have been instructed to divert, follow the ATC instructions given)



Step 3

: If ATC are able to provide vectors and altitude assignments, then follow these. If they are not, then select a suitable heading to take you in the general direction of the airport (monitor traffic to ensure separation is complied with at all times)



Step 4

: Check terrain en-route and select a sensible altitude to ensure terrain clearance (if ATC have not assigned one)



Step 5

: Monitor the airspace you are flying through in case you need to change to another active frequency



Step 6

: Once you are en-route, you can set up for the approach
