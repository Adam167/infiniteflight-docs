# Very High Frequency (VHF) Omni-Directional Range (VOR) Approach



## What is a VOR?

The VHF Omni-Directional Range (VOR) is a ground-based transmitter that emits radio signals and is identified with it's own frequency and three letter code. Aircraft equipped with VHF Navigation Receivers can then interpret these signals and use them for navigation purposes. To use VOR's for navigation, you will need to [tune to the correct frequency](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#tuning-to-a-vor-or-adf), and then [display this in the cockpit](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#displaying-a-vor-in-your-aircraft).



## What is the Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI)?

The Horizontal Situation Indicator or HSI, is the primary instrument used for navigation in Infinite Flight. It consists of the following elements:



- Compass rose orientated with the current aircraft heading
- Blue heading bug
- Single blue arrow to represent BRG (bearing) 1 - when tuned to a navigation source (ILS, VOR or NBD)
- Double blue arrow to represent BRG (bearing) 2 - when tuned to a navigation source (ILS, VOR or NBD)
- Course Deviation Indicator (CDI) that is magenta in color for GPS, and light green for NAV 1 and NAV 2



## How to Set Up your Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI)

Step 1

: [Tune the VOR](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#tuning-to-a-vor-or-adf) by tapping the VOR from your [Map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#map) or [Mini Map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#mini-map), selecting the VOR from the list displayed, and then tapping "Set NAV 1 (or 2)"



Step 2

: [Display the VOR](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#displaying-a-vor-in-your-aircraft) by tapping "NAV" on the Fly Screen to show the Avionics tab, and ensure that either BRG 1 (or 2) have NAV 1 (or 2) displayed (dependent on which NAV you tuned the VOR to)



Step 3

: Lastly, within the Avionics tab, make sure to change the "SOURCE" to NAV 1 (or 2) as required, and then adjust the respective course (CRS 1 or 2) to the desired radial you want to fly



## How to Navigate using a VOR



Step 1

: Prepare your flight plan by determining the direction of travel and any navigation aids (such as VORs) that could be used to assist with your route



Step 2

: Ensure that you have planned ahead, this means using our step by step guides to [tune](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#tuning-to-a-vor-or-adf) and [display](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#displaying-a-vor-in-your-aircraft) the required VOR(s), change the CRS(s) to the desired radial(s) that you wish to intercept, and then finally have SOURCE set to either NAV 1 (or 2 as required)



Tip

: You can only display the CDI for either NAV 1 or NAV 2, however you can still set up NAV 1 and NAV 2 with the same/different VOR(s) and/or Course(s) to reduce your workload once airborne!



Step 3

: Next, look at where you are in relation to the VOR, use the VOR arrow on your HSI (blue) to help you. You can also use your [Map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#map) and [Mini Map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#mini-map)



Step 4

: Plan how you are going to intercept the radial and what you expect the indications to look like when approaching the radial



Tip

: We recommend a closing angle no greater than 45 degrees, however you may need to use less if you are close to the VOR otherwise you may overshoot the intercept!



Step 5

: As the Course Deviation Indicator (CDI) comes "alive" it will start to display the lateral deviation, use this and adjust your heading to fly the desired radial



Tip

: The CDI can come "alive" pretty quickly, especially if you are close to the VOR - keep an eye on the VOR blue arrow, it will give you a heads up when you are getting close to the radial as it swings round!



**Example:**

We have departed Athens (LGAV) off of Runway 03R, and are making a right downwind departure with the intention to intercept the 270 radial inbound to the ATV VOR. 

![Avionics Set-Up](_images/manual/screens/avionics-set-up.png)

Before departure we have tuned and displayed the ATV VOR (NAV 1 in this example), selected a CRS of 270 and ensured that the SOURCE is set to NAV 1.

![Before Departure](_images/manual/screens/before-departure.png)

Once we depart and make a right turn to head downwind, our heading will be 210, this is a 60 intercept so instead we have adjusted our heading to 240 degrees to give us a slightly shallower intercept as we are not far from the VOR.

![Right Downwind](_images/manual/screens/right-downwind.png)

With a heading of 240 degrees, we can watch the blue arrow (representing where the VOR is) start to move, as this gets closer to 270 I have started to anticipate when the turn will be required onto a heading of 270.

![Adjusted Intercept Heading](_images/manual/screens/adjusted-intercept-heading.png)

As the CDI becomes "alive" I begin the turn to fly the 270 radial inbound to the beacon. 

![CDI Alive](_images/manual/screens/cdi-alive.png)

Once we are on this heading, we can adjust it to ensure that we are tracking the 270 radial (taking wind drift into account).

![Heading 270](_images/manual/screens/heading-270.png)



Tip

: Use the dashed green line on the HSI to help you understand the affect of wind drift when selecting an alternate heading

## What is a VOR Approach?

VOR Approaches are currently not supported in Infinite Flight by ATC, however you can still fly a VOR Approach using the techniques shown here, we recommend finding an uncontrolled airport or quiet area to practise in.



## How do I fly a VOR Approach?



Step 1

: En-route to your destination, check the weather to determine the best runway for arrival - once you have done this, check the approach chart for that runway, and if it has a VOR Approach, you can start to set up for this approach



Step 2

: Ensure that you have [tuned](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#tuning-to-a-vor-or-adf) the required VOR(s) for the approach and changed the CRS(s) to the desired radial(s) that you wish to intercept



Step 3

: If you are no longer following your flight plan or [GPS Navigation](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#gps-navigation) is no longer required, you can [display](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#displaying-a-vor-in-your-aircraft) the required VOR(s) by setting "SOURCE" to either NAV 1 (or 2 as required)



Step 4

: Intercept the radials at the correct distance/altitude as per your chart and always think of the next event to stay ahead of the aircraft and to know what is coming next



Tip

: Feel overloaded? Reduce your workload by engaging the [Autopilot](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/autopilot#autopilot) and using both Heading and V/S to follow the profile instead of manual flying



Step 5

: Continue to monitor both your lateral and vertical deviation and make the adjustments required to keep these centralized. At the appropriate point, based on speed control by ATC and the recommended profile for your aircraft type; continue to configure to meet the Stability Approach Criteria



## What is the Stability Approach Criteria (SAC)?

The Stability Approach Criteria (SAC) is there to access if you have flown a stable approach, and whether to continue to land or go-around.



All approaches must meet the SAC by 1000ft AGL (above ground level). The SAC are:



- In the planned landing configuration
- Stabilized on the correct vertical profile
- Stabilized at the target approach speed




If any of the SAC are not met, a [go-around](/guide/flying-guide/descent-to-landing/go-around-baulked-landing#go-around%2Fbaulked-landing) must be flown.



Once your final configuration has been selected and you have decelerated to your target approach speed, we recommend remaining  within the following tolerances in order to access your stability:



| Parameter          | Tolerance                                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Speed              | Target Approach Speed -5/+10 kts                           |
| Vertical Speed     | No more than 1000ft/min*                                   |
| Pitch              | No more than -2.5 degrees nose down or +10 degrees nose up |
| Bank               | Angle not exceeding 7 degrees                              |
| Lateral Navigation | No more than 1 dot of lateral deviation                    |

**Environmental conditions such as a tailwind, or a steeper than usual flight path angle could increase the descent rate required to more than 1000ft/min*
