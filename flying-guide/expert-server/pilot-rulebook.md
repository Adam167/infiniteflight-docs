# Pilot Rulebook



## Violations

A brief summary is below but more information can be found on our dedicated [Violation](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/violations) page:



Level 1 Violation

: If a pilot receives 3 or more Level 1 Violations in one flight, they will automatically be removed from the server and will have to start a flight again



Level 2 Violation (Amber)

: The pilot is disconnected from the server but can continue the flight offline. The pilot may return to the Expert Server immediately by starting a new flight provided the number of Level 2 and 3 Violations remain under the server allowed limits



Level 3 Violation (Red)

: The pilot is disconnected from the server but can continue the flight offline. The pilot will not be able to return to the Expert Server after the flight has been ended, with access being restricted for 7 days following this



Tip

: This page should help you identify the reason why you received a violation, however they are sometimes generic and the specific circumstances to your situation may not be listed. Still not sure, why not try and [contact the controller directly](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/violations#appealing-a-level-2-or-3-violation) on our Community Forum?



## Rules of the Expert Server

Below is a complete list of all the reasons that can be used by Controllers when issuing a Pilot with a [Violation](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/violations):



 -    Not following procedures broadcast on ATIS or in a published TFR/NOTAM
 -    Pushback/taxiing without clearance
 -    Crashing/taxiing into other aircraft/buildings/objects*
 -    Taking-off/landing from a taxiway or grass
 -    Entering the runway without clearance
 -    Taking-off/landing without clearance
 -    Not following the issued sequence
 -    Not following the cleared altitude/heading/speed
 -    Pilots who do not respond to an instruction after 2-3 attempts**
 -    Pilots sending duplicate messages or unnecessary requests 
 -    Spamming a frequency
 -    Repeated disruption
 -    Insulting or inappropriate call-signs/usernames or flight path/plan(s)
 -    Call-signs/usernames with profanity or discriminating/racist terms
 -    Excessive speed in the airport environment***



**Rendering issues may mean that Pilots did not see the other aircraft/buildings/objects, Controllers will only issue Violations to Pilots that have blatantly done it on purpose*



***Pilots descending via VNAV will only be issued a violation after a warning if they are unresponsive **AND** conflict with others*



****Speed which results in rapid closure with other aircraft, loss of separation, or airspace disruption may be deemed “excessive”*



> Fighter aircraft must not exceed 350KIAS when below 10,000ft and under ATC control, however Pilots are expected to maintain a reasonable speed in the vicinity of other aircraft or when instructed to slow down by Controllers. Reporting for excessive speed can be issued when a lack of etiquette is shown. Standard speed restrictions for commercial aircraft also apply to military cargo aircraft (i.e. maximum 250 KIAS when below 10,000ft and under ATC control)
