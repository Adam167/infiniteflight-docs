# Pushback and Engine Start            




## Electrical, Signs and Lights

 

When you first spawn at the gate, make sure to access the [Systems](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/systems#systems) menu and select the following:



| Electrical  | Action    |
| ----------- | --------- |
| Master Batt | **ON**    |
| APU*        | **START** |

{.checklist}

*If fitted – not all aircraft are currently equipped with an APU




| Passengers | Action |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Seat Belts | **ON** |
| No Smoking | **ON** |

{.checklist}



| Lights | Action |
| ------ | ------ |
| Nav    | **ON** |

{.checklist}



Access the [Ground Services](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/ground-services) menu and select the following services: 



| Ground    | Action  |
| --------- | ------- |
| PAX       | **TAP** |
| CATERING  | **TAP** |
| CARGO     | **TAP** |
| GND POWER | **TAP** |

{.checklist}



> For ground services to be used the aircraft must be parked at a stand that is large enough for that aircraft type, the parking brake set and the engines and beacon set to off. Pushback is only possible when all other ground services are deselected (provided the aircraft is capable of pushback)



## Pushback

 

Step 1

: Check surroundings to make sure it is clear, use the [Cameras](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/cameras#camera) and [Mini Map](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#mini-map) to help you. If ground services have been used, these must be deselected before pushback



Step 2

: Access the [Ground Services](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/ground-services) menu and deselect the following services if they have been selected (they will be highlighted in orange if they have been selected):

 

| Ground    | Action  |
| --------- | ------- |
| PAX       | **TAP** |
| CATERING  | **TAP** |
| CARGO     | **TAP** |
| GND POWER | **TAP** |

{.checklist}



| Pushback   | Action  |
| ---------- | ------- |
| Attach Tug | **TAP** |

{.checklist}



Step 3

: Tune to the active frequency and [request pushback](/guide/flying-guide/atc-communication/atis-pushback-and-taxi#pushback-communication-summary), or if there is no active ATC, tune to the Unicom frequency – listen for traffic before starting your pushback

 

Step 4

: Access the [Systems](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/systems#systems) menu and select the following:

 

| Lights | Action |
| ------ | ------ |
| Beacon | **ON** |

{.checklist}



Step 5

: Access the [Ground Services](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/ground-services) menu and select the following:

| Pushback | Action  |
| -------- | ------- |
| Push     | **TAP** |

{.checklist}



Step 6

: Make sure to have a plan on where to push. ATC may tell you what runway to expect for departure too. Use the [Cameras](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/cameras#camera) and [Mini Map](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#mini-map) throughout the pushback and the [Rudder](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) for directional control

 

Step 7

: When you’re ready to stop the pushback, access the [Ground Services](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/ground-services) menu and select the following:

 

| Pushback   | Action  |
| ---------- | ------- |
| Push       | **TAP** |
| Detach Tug | **TAP** |

{.checklist}



Tip

:   When aligning your aircraft with the taxiway centerline, anticipation is required. Don’t forget that the larger the aircraft, the sooner you will have to start the turn!

 

## Engine Start

Engine start can commence during or after the push back.

 

Step 1

: Check surroundings to make sure it is clear, use the [Cameras](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/cameras#camera) and [Mini Map](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#mini-map) to help you

 

Step 2

: Access the [Systems](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/systems#systems) menu and select the following:

 

| Engines       | Action  |
| ------------- | ------- |
| Eng ‘X’ 0% N1 | **TAP** |

{.checklist}



The start sequence for the engine you have selected will begin.

 

Tip

:   For a realistic experience, start one engine at a time - wait for the % N1 to be green before starting the next engine.

 

Alternatively you can use the **Auto Start** function for a more easy experience, select the following:

 

| Misc       | Action  |
| ---------- | ------- |
| Auto Start | **TAP** |

{.checklist}



Step 3

: Once at least one engine is running, access the [Systems](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/systems#systems) menu and select the following:

 

| Electrical | Action  |
| ---------- | ------- |
| APU*       | **OFF** |

{.checklist}



*If fitted – not all aircraft are currently equipped with an APU
