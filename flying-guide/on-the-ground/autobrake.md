# Autobrake

The autobrake system has two main purposes, these are:

- reduce the braking distance in case of an aborted takeoff
- establish and maintain a selected deceleration rate during landing, thereby improving passenger comfort and reducing crew workload



When selecting an autobrake setting, the spoilers will automatically **ARM** in preparation for take-off or landing. 



## Take-Off

Before departure, the autobrake should always be set to **MAX** (if fitted) so that the aircraft is configured correctly in the event of a rejected take-off (RTO).



To do this, access the [Systems](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/systems#systems) menu and select the following:



| Misc       | Action  |
| ---------- | ------- |
| Autobrakes | **MAX** |

{.checklist}



## Landing

For landing, the pilot can elect to do manual braking, or set an autobrake setting (i.e. **LOW** or **MED**). It is recommended that autobrake is always selected (if fitted), as this can always be disconnected during the landing roll if it is no longer required. 



To do this, access the [Systems](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/systems#systems) menu and select the following:



| Misc       | Action             |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| Autobrakes | **LOW** or **MED** |

{.checklist}



> **MAX** is not available for landing and will automatically default to **MED** if selected when not on the ground
