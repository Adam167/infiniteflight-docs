# Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs)       



## What is a TFR?

![KASE and KEGE Active TFRs](_images/manual/frames/tfr.png)



A Temporary Flight Restriction, referred to as a TFR, is a block of airspace that has had restrictions put in place. This could be due to numerous factors such as:



- movement of government officials
- natural disasters
- or other special events



Within Infinite Flight, TFRs can be found on the Expert Server and are depicted by red/orange circles (which can vary in size). They are used for airports that have permanent restrictions or temporarily for special events. The different colors and their meaning is shown below:



| Color  | Meaning  |
| ------ | -------- |
| Red    | Active   |
| Orange | Inactive |

## How to comply with TFRs

To avoid violations being issued due to not complying with active TFRs, the following steps are recommended:



Step 1

: Once you have filed your [flight plan](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#flight-planning) (if applicable), check the route on your [map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#map) or [mini map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#mini-map) for any red/orange circles



Step 2

: If you will be passing through/coming close to any of these TFRs, or your destination(s) have TFRs, then tap on (or close to) the circle on your map/mini map



Step 3

: Select the TFR from the dropdown list



Step 4

: The information associated with that TFR will be displayed, check to see if it is active, or will be active when you are flying near to it



Tip

: Once TFRs become active, all aircraft must comply with them, regardless of when your flight was started



Step 5

: If it is or will be active, and you will be flying through it (i.e. within the floor to ceiling range), then ensure that you fully comply with the TFR **before** departure



Tip

: If you are outside of the radius or altitude of the active TFR, then the TFR does not apply to you (e.g. if the TFR has a ceiling of 10,000ft and you are higher than this, you can ignore the TFR) 



Step 6

: If you are unable to comply with the TFR, then change your routing, altitude and/or destination as appropriate to avoid being [issued with a violation](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/violation-reasons#failure-to-follow-tfr)



Step 7

: We also recommend checking the [IFC](https://community.infiniteflight.com) for upcoming events that may have temporary TFRs added, as these may not be displayed on your [map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#map) or [mini map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#mini-map) yet



Tip

: If you use an Android device, there is currently an ongoing issue where TFRs sometimes will not show until you restart the app. Before flying it is recommended to always check the [IFC](https://community.infiniteflight.com) for temporary TFRs that may be in place for an event
