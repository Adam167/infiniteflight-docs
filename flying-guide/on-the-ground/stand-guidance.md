# Stand Guidance           



Not all stands have stand guidance, however those that do will provide guidance to aircraft for parking. Watch the video below to learn how to use it!

## Approaching the Gate

When approaching the stand guidance, it will show an "OK" message, the Gate number, aircraft type and airport name. If "Too Large" or  "Too Small" is shown, you cannot park at that gate.



Once aligned on the centerline, the stand guidance will provide distance to the stopping point along with lateral guidance to remain on the centerline



## Parked

When parked, the stand guidance will show an "OK" message, the gate number, aircraft type and airport name.
