# Taxi




## Trim and Flaps

 

Before you’re ready to taxi, you need to set your [Trim and Flaps](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) for take-off. Press and hold on each of them until you have the desired setting.



## Taxi, Rudder and Brakes

 

Step 1

: Check surroundings to make sure it is clear, use the [Cameras](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/cameras#camera) and [Mini Map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/mini-map#mini-map) to help you

 

Step 2

: [Request taxi](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/communication#communication) with the active ATC, or if there is no active ATC, announce taxi on the Unicom frequency – listen out whilst you’re on the move for other traffic

 

Step 3

: Release the [Park Brake](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) and increase [Power](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/hud#head-up-display-(hud)) to start the taxi

 

Tip

:   We recommend you do not exceed 40% N1 whilst taxiing, and once you’ve started to move, you typically don’t need more than idle power!

 

Step 4

: Use the [Rudder](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) to maintain the taxiway centreline and either the [Rud Brakes or Park Brake](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) to keep your speed under control

 

Tip

:   Do not exceed 35kts groundspeed to avoid in game violations, we recommend you keep you speed below 25kts in a straight line and 10kts or less during 90° turns for a safe operation.

 

Step 5

: If you need to cross a runway whilst taxiing, make sure to [request runway crossing](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/communication#communication) with the active ATC, or if there is no active ATC, announce crossing on the Unicom frequency – always check it’s clear before you enter the runway! Don’t forget to access the [Systems](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/systems#systems) menu and select the following:

 

| Lights  |        |
| ------- | ------ |
| Strobes | **ON** |
| Land    | **ON** |

 

Once you’re clear of the runway, you can turn these lights back to **OFF**.
