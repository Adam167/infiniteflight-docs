## Weight & Balance

 

Once you have spawned at the gate, tap on the [Pause Screen](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/fly-screen) button to access the [Weight & Balance](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/pause-menu#weight-%26-balance) page where you can adjust your fuel, passenger load, and cargo load.



Tip

: Make sure you carry enough fuel to take into account of exceptional circumstances such as stronger headwinds and traffic delays



## ATIS

 

The Automatic Terminal Information Service, more commonly known as ATIS, will send the latest airport information (if ATC is present) on a dedicated frequency provided you are within range. It will normally include:



- The latest METAR*
- Runway(s) in use
- REMARKS and/or NOTAMS to provide pilots with more information (e.g. "No Pattern Work Allowed")
- And if there are multiple frequencies open, which one to contact



**The Meteorological Terminal Air Report (more commonly known as a METAR), is the current weather at the airport and usually displays date/time recorded, wind direction and strength, visibility, weather and cloud, temperature and dew point, and finally pressure*



The Digital ATIS (D-ATIS) will display the same information as the ATIS, but in text format. To find the D-ATIS, follow the steps below:



Step 1

: By [tapping close to your chosen airport](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#getting-more-from-your-map-and-mini-map) on the map, a drop down list will appear where you can select the airport

 

Step 2

: The information tab will be displayed initially, tap the "wx" (weather) tab



Step 3

: Provided ATC is present at the selected airport (and using the ATIS frequency), the D-ATIS will display this information 



Tip

: Range for the D-ATIS is unlimited; use this to help with planning before tuning to an active frequency



Want to know what everything in the ATIS means? Visit our [ATC Manual](/guide/atc-manual/4.-atis/4.1-atis#4.1-atis) to find out!



## Flight Plan

![Map Screen](_images/manual/frames/flight-planning-map.png)
Once you have spawned at the gate, you can access the [Flight Planning](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#flight-planning) page by tapping on the [Globe](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/fly-screen) button. This will allow you to build your flight plan (you can also use the [Mini Map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#mini-map) to make adjustments).

## Airspace 

The different types of airspace are defined on the Map and Mini Map using a color code. These are shown in the following table:


| Airspace Type                   | Color Code  |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Class B                         | Blue        |
| Class C                         | Magenta     |
| Class D                         | Light Blue  |
| Terminal Control Area           | Light Green |
| Flight Information Region (FIR) | White       |

Pilots that want to add realism to their flight may wish to follow real world procedures, but for the purposes of Infinite Flight, the use of airspace by ATC has been simplified. For more information on what you can expect from ATC when flying, visit the [ATC Manual](/guide/atc-manual/5.-airspace/5.1-airspace#5.1-airspace).
