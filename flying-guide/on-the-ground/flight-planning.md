## Weight & Balance

 

Once you have spawned as the gate, by tapping on the [Pause Screen](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/fly#fly-screen) button you can access the [Weight & Balance](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/pause-menu#weight-%26-balance) page where you can adjust your fuel, passenger load, and cargo load.



Tip

: Make sure you carry enough fuel to take into account of exceptional circumstances such as stronger headwinds and traffic delays



## ATIS

 

The Automatic Terminal Information Service, more commonly known as ATIS, will display the latest airport information if ATC is present. It will normally include:



- The latest *METAR
- Runway(s) in use
- REMARKS or NOTAMS to provide pilots with more information (e.g. 'No Pattern Work allowed')
- And if there are multiple frequencies open, which one to contact



*The Meteorological Terminal Air Report (more commonly known as a METAR), is the current weather at the airport and usually displays date/time recorded, wind direction and strength, visibility, weather and cloud, temperature and dew point, and finally pressure.



What to know what everything in the ATIS means? Visit our [ATC Manual](/guide/atc-manual/4.-atis/4.1-atis#4.1-atis) to find out!

Once you have spawned at the gate, by tapping on the [Globe](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/fly#fly-screen) button you can access the [Flight Plan](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-plan#flight-plan-screen) page where you can build your flight plan. You can also use the [Mini Map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/mini-map#mini-map) to make adjustments.
