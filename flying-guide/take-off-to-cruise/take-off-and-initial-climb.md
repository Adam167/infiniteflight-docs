# Take-Off and Initial Climb



@[vimeo](416107656)



Tip

: You will rarely require full power for take-off; your weight, environmental factors such as altitude and temperature, and the runway length will effect how much thrust is required



If you have been cleared for take-off by ATC or if you're on Unicom, you can commence the take-off roll provided the runway is completely clear. To do this follow the steps below:



Step 1

: Set 50% N1, this allows the engines to stablize and prevent assymetric thrust



Step 2

: Once 50% N1 has stabilized, release brakes (if you haven't already) and progressively increase thrust to take-off power



Step 3

: At VR (rotate speed), pitch to 15 degrees nose up



Tip

: Try to maintain back pressure during the rotation, we recommend a rate of 3 degrees per second so it should take you 5 seconds to get to 15 degrees



Step 4

: Once stable at 15 degrees, adjust pitch to maintain V2+10 to V2+20kts (e.g. if V2 is 145kts, your target speed would be 155-165kts)



Step 5

: Positive climb? Gear up!



Step 6

: At 1000ft AAL (above aerodrome level), lower the nose to 10 degrees, reduce to climb power, and then allow the aircraft to accelerate



Step 7

: Retract the flaps as you approach the flap retraction speeds for your aircraft



Step 8

: Accelerate to 250kts, the speed restrictions on the SID (Standard Instrument Departure) or your aircraft climb speed (whichever is the lowest), then adjust pitch to maintain that speed



Tip

: Approaching a level off altitude (within 2000ft), reduce your rate of climb to 1500fpm (feet per minute) or less to make sure you don't bust the cleared altitude



Step 9

: When you resume your climb, reset your climb power, and adjust pitch to maintain the required speed
