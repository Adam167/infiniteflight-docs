# AutoPilot+



## What is AutoPilot+?

AutoPilot+ allows your flight to continue cruising in the background, adding flexibility to your flying experience in Infinite Flight. This feature helps manage long-haul flights and unexpected interruptions.

## How to use

Step 1

: Start a new flight from **Free Flight** Mode (Can either be Single or Multiplayer)


Step 2

: File a flight plan

Step 3 

: Climb to cruise

Step 4

: Check the Pause Menu, ensure AutoPilot+ is marked as active. It will automatically turn on when the following conditions are met:

- Your altitude is above 7000ft for prop aircraft or 28000ft for jet aircraft
- You are in level flight
- LNAV is on
- You are more than 30 minutes from your destination
- You are on the path of your flight plan
- All Engines are running
- No active warnings (E.g. Stall)

1. Shows status of AutoPilot+ (ON/OFF). Tap to show save conditions 
2. This pop up shows when your flight was last saved, and if all the save conditions have been met

Step 5

: Exit to the main menu


Your flight will continue in the background towards your destination following your flight plan. If you donâ€™t return to your flight before it reaches approximately 30 minutes from your destination, your flight will be paused. If you resume your flight before the 30 minute ETE (estimated time en route), it will resume at the appropriate location along your route.

1. This toggle is on by default if your flight can be saved, tap it if you don't wish to save your flight


## Resuming Your Flight

When you are ready to resume your flight, select **Continue Flight** from the AutoPilot+ area of the mode selection on the main menu, then tap continue.

1. The aircraft's current speed and altitude above a flight progress bar
2. Route, aircraft and time to destination
3. Time until the flight will expire
4. Tap here to delete your saved flight
5. Tap here to continue your flight

#### Why can't I resume my flight?
You have up to 48 hours from the last save to resume your flight, after that you will not be able to resume.

You will also not be able to resume if your aircraft has run out of fuel

Tip

: Need more time? The 48 hour time limit is from the last save. Gain more time by loading up the flight to trigger a new save. You may have to extend your flightplan to increase your ETA to destination to achieve this

## Useful Information

 - You may only have one flight saved at a time, you may start another flight while one is running in the background, however you won't be able to save your new flight
 - While your flight is running in the background, it will be visible to others (on multiplayer servers). However your aircraft will not be visible to other users after it reaches the 30 minutes ETE to destination. It will reappear when you resume the flight
 - You can set "Last Save" in the status bar to show how many seconds have elapsed since the flight was last saved
 - Flights are saved every 5 minutes while actively flying provided all the conditions are met. If you make a change, changing speed for example, a new save will be triggered
