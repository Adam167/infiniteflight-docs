# Crosswind/Tailwind Take-Off Technique

## Crosswind Take-Off



Step 1

: Utilise the ATIS and other weather information to determine the direction of the wind and crosswind component. Before commencement of the take-off roll, be sure to know which direction the wind is coming from



Step 2

: To perform a crosswind take-off, deflect you Aileron into wind (so if the wind is coming from the right, tilt your device to the right so that the right Aileron is up, and the left Aileron is down). To maintain the runway centerline, use the rudder. Without any input, your aircraft will turn into wind as speed increases (known as weathercocking) and you could lose control of your aircraft



Tip

: For indpendant control of your ailerons and rudder, make sure that auto-coordination is turned **OFF** in your Settings



Step 3

: As speed increases, reduce aileron deflection to prevent your wings from tipping



Step 4

: At VR (rotation speed), rotate as normal and gradually reduce any remaining inputs in your Rudder and Ailerons. To maintain the extended centerline you'll need to offset by flying slightly into wind



## Tailwind Take-Off



Where possible you should always try to take-off into wind, so try and pick the runway with the best headwind component. However, if an airport is busy, or if the weather means that there is no favourable runway, you may find that you have to take-off with a tailwind.  The take-off is very similar to a normal or crosswind take-off, but we have three extra tips to help you do this successfully:



Tip

: Increase thrust more gradually, the risk of asyemteirc thrust is increased with a tailwind component



Tip

: We recommend that you do not take-off if the tailwind component exceeeds 10kts



Tip

: Be more cautious when you rotate, a tail strike is more likely with a tailwind
