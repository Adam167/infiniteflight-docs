# Crosswind/Tailwind Take-Off Technique

## Crosswind Take-Off



Step 1

: Utilize the [ATIS](/guide/flying-guide/on-the-ground/flight-planning#atis) and other weather information to determine the direction of the wind and crosswind component. Before commencement of the take-off roll, be sure to know which direction the wind is coming from



Step 2

: To perform a crosswind take-off, deflect your [Aileron](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) into wind (so if the wind is coming from the right, tilt your device to the right so that the right Aileron is up, and the left Aileron is down). To maintain the runway centerline, use the [Rudder](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls). Without any input, your aircraft will turn into wind as speed increases (known as weather cocking) and you could lose control of your aircraft



Tip

: For independent control of your Ailerons and Rudder, make sure that auto-coordination is turned **OFF** in your [Settings](/guide/getting-started/home-user-interface/settings#settings)



Step 3

: As speed increases, reduce Aileron deflection to prevent your wings from tipping



Step 4

: At VR (rotation speed), rotate as normal and gradually reduce any remaining inputs in your Rudder and Ailerons. To maintain the extended centerline you'll need to offset by flying slightly into wind



## Tailwind Take-Off



Where possible you should always try to take-off into wind, so try and pick the runway with the best headwind component. However, if an airport is busy, or if the weather means that there is no favorable runway, you may find that you have to take-off with a tailwind.  The take-off is very similar to a [normal](/guide/flying-guide/take-off-to-cruise/take-off-and-initial-climb#take-off-and-initial-climb) or [crosswind take-off](/guide/flying-guide/take-off-to-cruise/crosswind-tailwind-take-off-technique#crosswind-take-off), but we have three extra tips to help you do this successfully:



Tip

: Increase thrust more gradually, the risk of asymmetric thrust is increased with a tailwind component



Tip

: We recommend that you do not take-off if the tailwind component exceeds 10kts



Tip

: Be more cautious when you rotate, a tail strike is more likely with a tailwind
