# Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) En-Route Navigation



## What does Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) mean?

Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) are a set of regulations that must be followed by pilots when operating an aircraft in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) or in particular airspace.



## What does Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) mean?

The specific conditions required to be classed as Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) vary by country and by the type of airspace being flown in. However, for the purposes of Infinite Flight, IMC is said to exist when the visibility is less than 3 statute miles (approximately 5000 meters). Therefore, when these conditions exist, VFR flight and pattern work will not be allowed by ATC.



Take note that IFR aircraft can fly in IMC or VMC (Visual Meteorological Conditions), but VFR (Visual Flight Rules) aircraft can only fly in VMC.



## Airspace

Controller airspace is defined by it's vertical jurisdiction, lateral boundaries and frequency range for the facility being operated. For the purposes of Infinite Flight, below is a summary for each Controller position:



| Position           | Vertical Jurisdiction | Lateral Boundary                                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Tower              | SFC - 5000ft AAL      | Most immediate ring/boundary surrounding the airport |
| Departure/Approach | SFC - 18,000ft/FL180  | 50nm                                                 |
| Center             | SFC - 60,000ft/FL600  | White boundaries                                     |

Note: Airspace parameters and ATC jurisdictions may be altered with the use of NOTAMs and/or TFRs during special events

The different types of airspace displayed on your [map and mini map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#map) are defined using a color code, and these are shown in the following table **for information only**{.red}:

 

| Airspace Type                   | Color Code  |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Class B                         | Blue        |
| Class C                         | Magenta     |
| Class D                         | Light Blue  |
| Terminal Control Area           | Light Green |
| Flight Information Region (FIR) | White       |

 

## IFR En-Route Procedures



Step 1

: A flight plan is always required for IFR flights, your instruments or the autopilot navigation system can be used to navigate and follow your flight plan



Tip

: [ForeFlight](/guide/getting-started/home-user-interface/settings#foreflight) is a great tool for flight planning, make sure to give it a go!



Step 2

: Make sure to modify your [cruising altitude](/guide/flying-guide/take-off-to-cruise/step-climbs-and-cruising-altitudes#ifr%2Fvfr-semi-circular-rules) to satisfy terrain clearance and IFR Semi-Circular rules



Step 3

: If you are approaching controlled airspace, make sure to tune in and listen out for other traffic



Step 4

: If it is a Radar Controller, you can request a [IFR Flight Following](/guide/atc-manual/6.-radar/6.5-flight-following#6.5-flight-following) or just simply [Check In](/guide/flying-guide/atc-communication/take-off-and-departure#departure-communication-summary). If it is a Tower Controller, you need to [request a transition](/guide/flying-guide/atc-communication/take-off-and-departure#pilot-to-tower-controller-communication-tables) to transit through their airspace



Tip

: If the airspace is uncontrolled, try tuning into the closest Unicom frequency to listen out for other traffic nearby. You can also send traffic advisories, or request them if you want more information for a particular airport



Step 5

: You can also request [Radar Vectors](/guide/atc-manual/6.-radar/6.11-radar-vectors#6.11-radar-vectors) or other ATC services, IFR separation rules (both for aircraft and terrain) will then apply
