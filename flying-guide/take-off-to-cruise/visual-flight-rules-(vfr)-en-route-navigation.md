# Visual Flight Rules (VFR) En-Route Navigation



## What does Visual Flight Rules (VFR) mean?

Visual Flight Rules (VFR) are a set of regulations that must be followed by pilots when operating an aircraft visually; and specifically, in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). 



Flights conducted under VFR can only be operated if the weather conditions are suitable. This means the pilot must be able to:



- navigate visually
- and 'see & avoid' obstacles such as terrain and other aircraft



## What does Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) mean?

Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) are a set of weather minima that are required for VFR flights to take place. 



The specific minima varies by country and by the type of airspace being flown in. However, for the purposes of Infinite Flight, VMC is said to exist when the visibility is 3 statute miles (approximately 5000 meters) or more. Therefore, when these conditions exist, VFR flight and pattern work will be allowed by ATC (terrain and traffic permitting).



Take note that IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) aircraft can fly in IMC (Instrument Meteorological Conditions) or VMC, but VFR aircraft can only fly in VMC.



## Airspace

Controller airspace is defined by it's vertical jurisdiction, lateral boundaries and frequency range for the facility being operated. For the purposes of Infinite Flight, below is a summary for each Controller position:



| Position           | Vertical Jurisdiction | Lateral Boundary                                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Tower              | SFC - 5000ft AAL      | Most immediate ring/boundary surrounding the airport |
| Departure/Approach | SFC - 18,000ft/FL180  | 50nm                                                 |
| Center             | SFC - 60,000ft/FL600  | White boundaries                                     |

Note: Airspace parameters and ATC jurisdictions may be altered with the use of NOTAMs and/or TFRs during special events

The different types of airspace displayed on your [map and mini map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#map) are defined using a color code, and these are shown in the following table **for information only**{.red}:

 

| Airspace Type                   | Color Code  |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Class B                         | Blue        |
| Class C                         | Magenta     |
| Class D                         | Light Blue  |
| Terminal Control Area           | Light Green |
| Flight Information Region (FIR) | White       |

 

## Right of Way

All aircraft, but in particular, VFR traffic; must be operated under a 'see and avoid' mentality. The main principle is that the aircraft that does not have right of way, must take corrective action, usually in the form of a right turn.



Tip

: If you have the right of way; maintain altitude, heading and speed (unless collision avoidance is required)



| Right of Way           | Rule                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Converging Traffic     | If aircraft are converging at approximately the same altitude, the aircraft on the other's right, has the right of way |
| Approaching Head On    | Niether aircraft has right of way and therefore, both must turn right to avoid |
| Overtaking an aircraft | The aircraft being overtaken has right of way, the aircraft overtaking, must overtake on the right |
| Landing                | Aircraft landing or on final approach have right of way over all other aircraft*. When two or more aircraft are approaching an airport, the aircraft at the lower altitude has the right of way** |



**Aircraft are not allowed to take advantage of this rule in order to force another aircraft off the runway that has already landed*

***Aircraft are not allowed to take advantage of this rule in order to cut in front of landing traffic. In addition, when active ATC is present, their sequencing superceeds this rule*



Tip

: Remember, if the aircraft is on your right, it has the right of way!



## VFR En-Route Procedures



Step 1

: A flight plan is not required but if you have one then you can use this to help you navigate



Tip

: [ForeFlight](/guide/getting-started/home-user-interface/settings#foreflight) is a great tool for flight planning, make sure to give it a go!



Step 2

: Use visual markers to help you such as terrain, coastlines, islands etc.



Step 3

: Make sure to modify your [cruising altitude](/guide/flying-guide/take-off-to-cruise/step-climbs-and-cruising-altitudes#ifr%2Fvfr-semi-circular-rules) to satisfy terrain clearance and VFR Semi-Circular rules



Step 4

: If you are approaching controlled airspace, make sure to tune in and listen out for other traffic



Step 5

: If it is a Radar Controller, you can [Check In](/guide/flying-guide/atc-communication/take-off-and-departure#departure-communication-summary) or request a [VFR Flight Following](/guide/atc-manual/6.-radar/6.5-flight-following#6.5-flight-following) (although the latter is recommended if you specifically want to fly VFR - if you have a flight plan, Controllers may think you are asking for an IFR Flight Following when checking in). If it is a Tower Controller, you need to [request a transition](/guide/flying-guide/atc-communication/take-off-and-departure#pilot-to-tower-controller-communication-tables) to transit through their airspace



Tip

: If the airspace is uncontrolled, try tuning into the closest Unicom frequency to listen out for other traffic nearby. You can also send traffic advisories, or request them if you want more information for a particular airport
