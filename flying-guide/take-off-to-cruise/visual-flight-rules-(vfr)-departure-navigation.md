# Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Departure Navigation



## What does Visual Flight Rules (VFR) mean?

Visual Flight Rules (VFR) are a set of regulations that must be followed by pilots when operating an aircraft visually; and specifically, in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). 



Flights conducted under VFR can only be operated if the weather conditions are suitable. This means the pilot must be able to:



- navigate visually
- and "see & avoid" obstacles such as terrain and other aircraft (maintaining a **MINIMUM** of 500ft vertical separation with other aircraft)



## What does Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) mean?

Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) are a set of weather minima that are required for VFR flights to take place. 



The specific minima varies by country and by the type of airspace being flown in. However, for the purposes of Infinite Flight, VMC is said to exist when the visibility is 3 statute miles (approximately 5000 meters) or more. Therefore, when these conditions exist, VFR flight and pattern work will be allowed by ATC (terrain and traffic permitting).



Take note that IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) aircraft can fly in IMC (Instrument Meteorological Conditions) or VMC, but VFR aircraft can only fly in VMC.



## VFR Pre-Flight Procedures

Step 1

: Check that the weather is VMC (minimum of 3 statute miles visibility*). You can do this by [accessing the 'wx' tab from you map or mini map](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#getting-more-from-your-map-and-mini-map)



Step 2

: We always recommend [filing a flight plan](/guide/flying-guide/on-the-ground/flight-planning#flight-planning), however it is not a requirement of VFR flights



Tip

: [ForeFlight](/guide/getting-started-guide/home-user-interface/settings#foreflight) is a great tool for flight planning, make sure to give it a go!



Step 3

: Research your route and [establish a cruising altitude](/guide/flying-guide/take-off-to-cruise/step-climbs-and-cruising-altitudes#ifr%2Fvfr-semi-circular-rules) that ensures terrain clearance and satisfies VFR Semi-Circular rules



**For Infinite Flight purposes, currently only visibility is taken into account to determine VMC*



## VFR Departure Procedures



Step 1

: Once you are at the holding point and ready for departure you can tune to the active frequency, or if there is no active ATC, tune to the Unicom frequency



There are two options for departure, these are:

- departing the airspace
- and [remaining in the pattern](/guide/flying-guide/take-off-to-cruise/remaining-in-the-pattern#remaining-in-the-pattern)



Step 2

: [Report ready for departure](/guide/flying-guide/atc-communication/take-off-and-departure#take-off-communication-summary) (or announce take-off on Unicom) and select the type of departure you intend on flying



Tip

: For more detail, make sure to check out the [Before Take-Off](/guide/flying-guide/take-off-to-cruise/before-take-off#before-take-off) step by step guide



Step 3

: If you're planning on departing the airspace, you will need to select the direction you intend on departing in (i.e. straight out, north, east, south or west)



Tip

: Don't forget, it is the direction you intend on departing the airspace in, not the overall direction that your flight plan takes you in 



Step 4

: After departure (assuming you are not remaining in the pattern), the Tower Controller will hand you over to the Radar Controller (if they are present). If ATC coverage is not available, you can switch to an appropriate frequency



Tip

: If there is active ATC, do not change frequency without permission!



Step 5

: If you have been handed over to a Radar Controller, you can either [Check In](/guide/atc-manual/6.-radar/6.4-departure-check-in#the-use-of-check-in) or request a [VFR Flight Following](/guide/atc-manual/6.-radar/6.5-flight-following#6.5-flight-following), although the latter is recommended if you specifically want to fly VFR (if you have a flight plan, Controllers may think you are asking for an IFR Flight Following when checking in)



Tip

: Both requests mean the same so make sure to only send one of the options!



Step 6

: Continue flying VFR and remember that you are responsible for terrain and traffic avoidance. ATC may however, issue vectors to de-conflict with IFR traffic. If this happens, continue to follow those instructions until you are told to "resume own navigation"
