## What are Cruising Altitudes?



A cruising altitude is the en-route phase of flight where an aircraft usually spends the majority of any flight. The altitude can vary due to a variety of factors including:



- Direction of flight (what heading)
- Length of flight (short flights will tend to cruise lower)
- Airspace or airway restrictions
- Traffic
- Technical defects



## IFR/VFR Semi-Circular Rules



Although the cruising altitude may vary dependent on some or all of the factors listed above, by convention, the following rules are observed:



**IFR** - Assuming you are in RVSM airspace

| Heading           | Level                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 360 - 179 degrees | ODD (e.g. FL330, FL350, FL370 etc)  |
| 180 - 359 degrees | EVEN (e.g. FL320, FL340, FL360 etc) |



**VFR** - Odd or even levels with an extra 500ft added to all levels

| Heading           | Level                             |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 360 - 179 degrees | ODD (e.g. 1500, 3500, 5500, etc)  |
| 180 - 359 degrees | EVEN (e.g. 2500, 4500, 6500, etc) |
