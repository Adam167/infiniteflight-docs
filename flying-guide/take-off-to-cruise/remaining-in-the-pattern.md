# Remaining in the Pattern



@[vimeo](416103249)



## What is a traffic pattern?



The traffic pattern is a standard flight path followed by aircraft when taking-off and landing while maintaining visual contact with the airport. It is a great way to practice and improve your flying, and to increase the amount of landings in your [logbook](/guide/getting-started-guide/home-user-interface/logbook)!



In Infinite Flight the pattern altitude is 1000ft AAL (above aerodrome level) for prop aircraft, and 1500ft AAL for jet aircraft. It consists of multiple legs, each being joined by a 90 degree turn, and these are shown in the image below:

## How do I fly a traffic pattern?



Ready to go? Follow the steps below:



Step 1

: Check out the [Before Take-Off](/guide/flying-guide/take-off-to-cruise/before-take-off#before-take-off) and [Take-Off and Initial Climb](/guide/flying-guide/take-off-to-cruise/take-off-and-initial-climb#take-off-and-initial-climb) pages on how to get rolling



Tip

: Before setting off, align your [heading bug](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/hud#head-up-display-(hud)) with the runway heading. You can then use this as a helpful reminder of what heading to turn to when making those 90 degrees turns between legs. It's also useful to [bug your altitude](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/hud#head-up-display-(hud)) so you don't bust it!



Step 2

: Passing 400ft AAL begin your initial 90 degree turn to enter either the left or right crosswind leg. Make sure to check if you've been told to make left or right traffic by ATC; or if you're on Unicom, listen to the other traffic to make sure you don't cause a conflict



Tip

: Not sure what left or right traffic is? For left traffic, you always turn left! And once you're on downwind, the airport will be on your left - it's the same for right traffic but on the right!



Step 3

: The crosswind leg will determine how wide your pattern is, for smaller aircraft you may not need to go out that far; for larger jet aircraft, you'll need the pattern to be a bit wider to allow for a safe turn onto final later on



Step 4

: Once you've made that second 90 degree turn onto downwind, if you're on Unicom you should [report your position](/guide/flying-guide/atc-communication/remaining-in-the-pattern#pilot-to-tower-controller-communication-tables), and continue to do so on all legs of the pattern for traffic awareness. If there is ATC, you don't need to if you've been cleared for the option



Tip

: Make sure to listen out, if there is ATC you may be given instructions that maintain separation with other aircraft. Don't forget to also keep an eye on your surroundings, you are just as responsible for making sure there are no conflicts - use the [Mini Map](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#mini-map) to help you



Step 5

: Abeam the touchdown zone, start to think about your final approach, different aircraft will need to be configured at different points



Step 6

: When the runway threshold is a 45 degree angle from you, start your 90 degree turn onto base leg, depending on what aircraft you're in, you may need to start your descent too if you haven't already



Step 7

: The final turn is the most tricky, anticipation is required and if you have a strong wind behind you, you'll need to take this into account too



Step 8

: Try to control your descent so that you roll out on final, on profile. Don't worry if you're a bit high or low, adjust your pitch and power to get back on profile
