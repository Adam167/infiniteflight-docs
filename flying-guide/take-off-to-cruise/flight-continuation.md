# Flight Continuation



## What is Flight Continuation?

Flight Continuation allows pilots to pause and resume their flights, adding flexibility to your flying experience in Infinite Flight. This feature helps manage long-haul flights and unexpected interruptions.

## How to use

Step 1

: Start a new flight from **Free Flight** Mode (Can either be Single or Multiplayer)


Step 2

: File a flight plan

Step 3 

: Climb to cruise

Step 4

: Check the Pause Menu, ensure Flight Resume is marked ON. It will automatically turn on when the following conditions are met:

- Your altitude is above 7000ft for prop aircraft or 20000ft for jet aircraft
- You are in level flight
- LNAV is on
- You are more than 30 minutes from your destination
- You are on the path of your flight plan

Step 5

: Exit to the main menu


Your flight will continue in the background towards your destination following your flight plan. If you donâ€™t return to your flight before it reaches approximately 30 minutes from your destination, your flight will be paused. If you resume your flight before the 30 minute ETE (estimated time en route), it will resume at the appropriate location along your route.

## Resuming Your Flight

When you are ready to resume your flight, select **Active Flight** from the Mode selection menu, then tap continue.


#### Why can't I resume my flight?
You have up to 48hrs from the last save to resume your flight, after that you will not be able to resume.

You will also not be able to resume if your aircraft has run out of fuel



## Limitations

 - You may only have one flight saved at a time, you may start another flight while one is running in the background, however you won't be able to save your new flight
 - While your flight is running in the background, it will be visible to others (on multiplayer servers). However your aircraft will not be visible to other users after it reaches the 30 minutes ETE to destination. It will reappear when you resume the flight.
