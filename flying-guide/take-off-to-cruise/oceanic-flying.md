# Oceanic Flying



## What is Oceanic Flying?

Oceanic Flying is exactly that, flying across large stretches of ocean to connect continents.  It is unique in that it often involves flying for considerable lengths of time with limited radar coverage, and with limited options for diversions.  



## What is an Organized Track System (OTS)?

An Organized Track System (OTS) is often used whilst flying these stretches of airspace. They are a set of predetermined routes that are updated regularly to help optimize traffic flow and satisfy separation requirements.



The North Atlantic (NAT) Tracks, also known as the North Atlantic Organized Track System (NAT-OTS), is an example of these structured flight routes. As the principle is the same for other OTSs, only the NAT Tracks are covered in this guide. 



The NAT Tracks cover a vast area, laterally it includes multiple Control Areas (CTAs) that stretch form the northeast of North America, all the way to western Europe. And vertically, a band of airspace between FL285 and FL420*.



**Note that FL290 and FL410 are the last usable flight levels that can be assigned to an aircraft operating within this band of airspace*



## How do the NAT Tracks work?

Due to the large horizontal separation criteria, and limited height band; the airspace can be very congested and therefore the OTS is constructed to accommodate as many flights as possible with two major alternating flows:



- a westbound flow departing Europe in the morning
- an eastbound flow departing North America in the evening



As well as this, due to weather patterns (including the presence of jet streams); the NAT Tracks are aligned to minimize any headwinds and to maximize tailwinds. This results in much more efficiency by reducing fuel burn and flight time. But for this to be possible, the routes are updated twice daily to take into account the shifting winds aloft and the principal traffic flow.



## What do the NAT Track labels mean?

In the westbound daytime system, the track most northerly, at its point of origin, is designated Track A (Alpha). The next most northerly track is designated as Track B (Bravo), this is then repeated as tracks move more southerly.

The opposite is true in the eastbound nighttime system. The most southerly track, at its point of origin, is designated Track Z (Zulu). The next most southerly track, as Track Y (Yankee); and so on.



## How do I fly a NAT Track?



Step 1

: Before departure, decide on the best NAT Track to use based on your destination, the aircraft weight (which will determine your [initial cruising altitude](/guide/flying-guide/take-off-to-cruise/step-climbs-and-cruising-altitudes#step-climbs-and-cruising-altitudes)) and the prevailing winds (there are loads of online tools that you can use to help with this)



Step 2

: [Load your departure](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#selecting-departure%2C-arrival-and-approach-procedures) and then [add a series of waypoints](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#flight-planning) that will take you close to the start of the track you wish to use



Step 3

: From the map, tap the desired track and select the + icon to insert it into your flight plan. Much like an instrument procedure, a track in itâ€™s entirety will display a green bracket



Step 4

: Once airborne (and provided you have been given permission to change frequency), you only need to [Check In](/guide/atc-manual/6.-radar/6.4-departure-check-in#6.4-departure-%2F-check-in) with Departure or Center (if ATC is active). You will be expected to continue following your flight plan and they will only vector you if required



Tip

: You do not need to stay with your device for the whole flight, but we do recommend you stay until you have reached your initial cruising altitude as a minimum (just in case ATC need to provide de-confliction)
