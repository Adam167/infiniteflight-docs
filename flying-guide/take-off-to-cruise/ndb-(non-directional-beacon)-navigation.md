# NDB (Non-Directional Beacon) Navigation



## What is an NDB?

The Non-Directional Beacon, otherwise known as NDB; is a ground-based transmitter that emits radio signals and is identified with it's own frequency and a code (normally two or three letters). Aircraft equipped with an Automatic Direction Finder (ADF) can then interpret these signals and use them for navigation purposes. To use NDB's for navigation, you will need to [tune to the correct frequency](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#tuning-to-a-vor-or-adf), and then [display this in the cockpit](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#displaying-an-adf-in-your-aircraft).



## What is the Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI)?

The Horizontal Situation Indicator or HSI, is the primary instrument used for navigation in Infinite Flight. It consists of the following elements:



- Compass rose orientated with the current aircraft heading
- Blue heading bug displaying the [Autopilot FCU](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/autopilot#autopilot) bugged heading
- Single blue pointer to represent BRG (bearing) 1 - when tuned to a navigation source (ILS, VOR or NDB) it will point to the navigation aid
- Double blue pointer to represent BRG (bearing) 2 - when tuned to a navigation source (ILS, VOR or NDB) it will point to the navigation aid
- Course Deviation Indicator (CDI) made up of the Course Pointer and Lateral Deviation Bar - displayed in magenta for GPS, and light green for NAV 1 and NAV 2

## How to Set Up your Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI)

Step 1

: [Tune the NDB](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#tuning-to-a-vor-or-adf) by tapping the NDB from your [Map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#map) or [Mini Map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#mini-map), selecting the NDB from the list displayed, and then tap "Set ADF 1"



Step 2

: [Display the NDB](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#displaying-an-adf-in-your-aircraft) by tapping "NAV" on the Fly Screen to show the Avionics tab, and ensure that either BRG 1 (or 2) have ADF displayed



## How to Navigate using an NDB



Step 1

: Prepare your flight plan by determining the direction of travel and any navigation aids (such as NDBs) that could be used to assist with your route



Step 2

: Ensure that you have planned ahead by using our step by step guides to help you - [tune](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#tuning-to-a-vor-or-adf) and [display](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#displaying-an-adf-in-your-aircraft) the required NDB



Tip

: You can only display the CDI for NAV 1 (or 2) and GPS, it is not available for ADF



Step 3

: Next, look at where you are in relation to the NDB, use the bearing pointer on your HSI (blue) to help you. You can also use your [Map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#map) and [Mini Map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#mini-map)



Step 4

: Plan how you are going to intercept the radial and what you expect the indications to look like when approaching it



Tip

: A good rule of thumb is to look at the difference between the current and desired bearings to/from the beacon, and turn twice the difference to get established, check out the example below!



Step 5

: To intercept a specific radial, imagine that the NDB is at the "head" of the blue bearing pointer (arrow) and that the aircraft is at the "tail" of the blue bearing pointer. If you are navigating "to" the beacon, you need to "pull" the tail of the blue bearing pointer round to the new position by turning towards the tail, the head will begin to "fall" away and when it is close to the desired bearing to the beacon that you want to fly, you can turn back to that bearing. If you are navigating "from" the beacon, you will need to "push" the head of the blue bearing pointer by turning away from the "tail". The head will begin to "fall" away and "pull" the tail round, when it is close to the desired bearing from the beacon that you want to fly, you can turn back to that bearing.



| To/From         | Direction of Turn  | Result                                        |
| --------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| To the Beacon   | Towards the tail   | Head will "fall" round to the desired bearing |
| From the Beacon | Away from the tail | Tail will "pull" round to the desired bearing |



**Example:**

We are flying just south of PHNY towards the Lanai (LLD) NDB on a heading of 360 degrees. The LLD NDB has been tuned to ADF 1, and then displayed on BRG (bearing) 1. Today, we have planned to fly a bearing of 360 to the beacon (180 radial) however, in the below image you can see that the actual bearing to the beacon is 350 (or the 170 radial).



![170 Radial](_images/manual/frames/170-radial.png)



If we were to just turn towards the beacon (heading 350 degrees), we would never establish ourselves on the 180 radial; instead, we would just maintain the 170 radial that we are currently on. To fly the 180 radial, we need to determine the difference between the "desired" and "current" bearings to the beacon - in this example, the difference is 10 degrees. To intercept the desired radial we recommend doubling the bearing error (as a rule of thumb) - so in this case, we need to turn 20 degrees.



![Heading 340](_images/manual/frames/heading-340.png)



In the image above, you can see we have changed the aircraft heading from 360 to 340 degrees by turning towards the "tail". The current bearing to the beacon is still 350 but now that we have changed our heading, the head (arrow) of the blue bearing pointer will begin to "fall" away and as it approaches a bearing of 360 to the beacon, we can then start to turn right again to a heading of 360.



![180 Radial](_images/manual/frames/180-radial.png)



Once on the desired bearing, we can then monitor the blue bearing pointer and adjust out heading to take into account wind (ensuring that we are tracking the correct radial).

Tip

: Use the dashed green line on the HSI to help you understand the affect of wind drift when selecting an alternate heading
