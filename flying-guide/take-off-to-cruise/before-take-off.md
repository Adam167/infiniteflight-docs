# Before Take-Off



Arrived at the holding point and ready to go? Follow our step by step guide below to make sure you're all set for Take-Off!



Step 1

: Check surroundings to make sure it is clear, use the [Cameras](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/cameras#camera) and [Mini Map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/mini-map#mini-map) to help you



Step 2

: Tune to the active frequency and [request take-off](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/communication#communication) when you're ready for departure, or if there is no active ATC, tune to the Unicom frequency

  

Step 3

: Once you have clearance (if applicable) and it is clear on the approach; access the [Systems](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/systems#systems) menu and select the following:

 

| LIGHTS  |        |
| ------- | ------ |
| Strobes | **ON** |
| Land    | **ON** |

 

Step 4

: If you have been cleared to Line Up and Wait (LUAW) by ATC, taxi onto the runway centreline and come to a stop. If you have been cleared for take-off by ATC or if you're on Unicom, you can commence the take-off roll straight away provided the runway is completely clear.

 

Tip

:   Performance limited? If youâ€™re performance limited due to aircraft weight, environmental factors or the runway length, use the oversteer technique to save as much runway as possible for departure
