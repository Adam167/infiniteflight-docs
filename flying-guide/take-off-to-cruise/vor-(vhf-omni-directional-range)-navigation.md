# VOR (VHF Omni-Directional Range) Navigation



@[vimeo](455590960)



## What is a VOR?

The VHF (Very High Frequency) Omni-Directional Range, otherwise known as VOR; is a ground-based transmitter that emits radio signals and is identified with it's own frequency and three letter code. Aircraft equipped with VHF Navigation Receivers can then interpret these signals and use them for navigation purposes. To use VOR's for navigation, you will need to [tune to the correct frequency](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#tuning-to-a-vor-or-adf), and then [display this in the cockpit](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#displaying-a-vor-in-your-aircraft).



In addition to this, the following definitions are essential in understanding the theory behind VOR Navigation:



| Term   | Definition                                         |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Radial | A radial is always the bearing **from** the beacon |
| To     | Magnetic bearing **to** the beacon                 |
| From   | Magnetic bearing **from** the beacon               |

## What is the Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI)?

The Horizontal Situation Indicator or HSI, is the primary instrument used for navigation in Infinite Flight. It consists of the following elements:



- Compass rose orientated with the current aircraft heading
- Blue heading bug displaying the [Autopilot FCU](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/autopilot#autopilot) bugged heading
- Single blue pointer to represent BRG (bearing) 1 - when tuned to a navigation source (ILS, VOR or NDB) it will point to the navigation aid
- Double blue pointer to represent BRG (bearing) 2 - when tuned to a navigation source (ILS, VOR or NDB) it will point to the navigation aid
- Course Deviation Indicator (CDI) made up of the Course Pointer and Lateral Deviation Bar - displayed in magenta for GPS, and light green for NAV 1 and NAV 2

## How to Set Up your Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI)

Step 1

: [Tune the VOR](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#tuning-to-a-vor-or-adf) by tapping the VOR from your [Map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#map) or [Mini Map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#mini-map), selecting the VOR from the list displayed, and then tap "Set NAV 1 (or 2)"



Step 2

: [Display the VOR](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#displaying-a-vor-in-your-aircraft) by tapping "NAV" on the Fly Screen to show the Avionics tab, and ensure that either BRG 1 (or 2) have NAV 1 (or 2) displayed (dependent on which NAV you tuned the VOR to)



Step 3

: Lastly, within the Avionics tab, make sure to change the "SOURCE" to NAV 1 (or 2) as required, and then adjust the respective course (CRS 1 or 2) to the desired magnetic bearing that you want to fly



## How to Navigate using a VOR



Step 1

: Prepare your flight plan by determining the direction of travel and any navigation aids (such as VORs) that could be used to assist with your route



Step 2

: Ensure that you have planned ahead by using our step by step guides to help you - [tune](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#tuning-to-a-vor-or-adf) and [display](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#displaying-a-vor-in-your-aircraft) the required VOR(s), change the CRS(s) to the desired magnetic bearing(s) that you wish to intercept, and then finally have SOURCE set to either NAV 1 (or 2 as required)



Tip

: You can only display the CDI for either NAV 1 or NAV 2, however you can still set up NAV 1 and NAV 2 with the same/different VOR(s) and/or CRS(s) to reduce your workload once airborne!



Step 3

: Next, look at where you are in relation to the VOR, use the bearing pointer on your HSI (blue) to help you. You can also use your [Map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#map) and [Mini Map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#mini-map)



Step 4

: Plan how you are going to intercept the pre-set course and what you expect the indications to look like when approaching it



Tip

: We recommend a closing angle no greater than 45 degrees, however you may need to use less if you are close to the VOR otherwise you may overshoot during the intercept!



Step 5

: As you approach the intercept, the Lateral Deviation Bar of the CDI will come "alive", use this to help judge the turn onto your desired course



Tip

: The Lateral Deviation Bar can come "alive" pretty quickly, especially if you are close to the VOR - keep an eye on the blue bearing pointer, it will always show the current magnetic bearing to the beacon, use this to give you a heads up when you are getting close to the course you want to fly!



**Example:**

We have departed Athens (LGAV) off of Runway 03R, and are making a right downwind departure with the intention to intercept the 090 radial of the ATV VOR and use this to fly a magnetic bearing of 270 to the beacon.



![VOR Example](_images/manual/graphics/vor-radial-example.jpg)



Before departure we have tuned and displayed the ATV VOR (NAV 1 in this example), selected a CRS of 270 and ensured that the SOURCE is set to NAV 1.

![Avionics Set-Up](_images/manual/frames/avionics-set-up.jpg)

Once we depart and make a right turn to head downwind, our heading will be 210, this is a 60 intercept so instead we have adjusted our heading to 240 degrees to give us a slightly shallower intercept as we are not far from the VOR.

![Right Downwind](_images/manual/frames/right-downwind.jpg)

With a heading of 240 degrees, we can watch the blue bearing pointer (representing where the VOR is) start to move, as this gets closer to 270 I have started to anticipate when the turn will be required onto a heading of 270.

![Adjusted Intercept Heading](_images/manual/frames/adjusted-intercept-heading.jpg)

As the Lateral Deviation Bar comes "alive" I begin the turn to fly the 270 magnetic bearing to the beacon. 

![CDI Alive](_images/manual/frames/cdi-alive.jpg)

Once we are on this heading, we can adjust it to ensure that we are tracking on the 090 radial to the beacon (taking wind drift into account).

Tip

: Use the dashed green line on the HSI to help you understand the affect of wind drift when selecting an alternate heading
