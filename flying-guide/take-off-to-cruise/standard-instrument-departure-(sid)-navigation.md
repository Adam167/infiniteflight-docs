# Standard Instrument Departure (SID) Navigation



## What is a SID?

Standard Instrument Departures, known as SIDs, are a published flight procedure that are followed by aircraft on an IFR flight plan immediately after departure. SIDs allow aircraft to depart an airspace following a pre-defined route (and in some cases with altitude/speed restrictions) that help them navigate adjacent airspaces, terrain and arriving traffic.



## What is a Transition?

"Transition" is a word commonly used in aviation and youâ€™re probably already familiar with requesting this with a Tower facility to transition through their airspace. A Transition when used with reference to SID/STARs refers to a branch of the procedure that will break you off in the direction of your destination. Not all procedures will have a transition but do keep an eye out for them as they will be beneficial when wanting a more direct routing.
