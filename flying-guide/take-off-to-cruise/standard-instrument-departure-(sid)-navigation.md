# Standard Instrument Departure (SID) Navigation


## What is a SID?

Standard Instrument Departures, known as SIDs, are a published flight procedure that are followed by aircraft on an IFR flight plan immediately after departure. SIDs allow aircraft to depart an airspace following a pre-defined route (and in some cases with altitude/speed restrictions) that help them navigate adjacent airspaces, terrain and arriving traffic.



## What is a Transition?

"Transition" is a word commonly used in aviation and youâ€™re probably already familiar with requesting this with a Tower facility to transition through their airspace. A Transition when used with reference to SID/STARs refers to a branch of the procedure that will break you off in the direction of your destination. Not all procedures will have a transition but do keep an eye out for them as they will be beneficial when wanting a more direct routing.



## How do I put a SID into my Flight Plan?

Step 1

: Once spawned, check the ATIS/D-ATIS for runway(s) and ATC preferred SID(s) in use. You should try to pick an ATC preferred SID and transition that takes your towards you destination



Tip

: Watch out in the ATIS for 'Straight Out Departures' or if you are told to maintain runway heading when cleared for take-off. ATC instructions supersede your Flight Plan and must be followed!



Step 2

: Load the SID into you flight plan by following our step by step guide [here](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#selecting-departure%2C-arrival-and-approach-procedures)



Step 3

: It's possible you may be given a different runway to what you were expecting and therefore might need to change your SID, be prepared and have a few options in case this happens 



## How do I fly a SID?

Step 1

: Now that your flight plan is loaded, we can utilize the [GPS Navigation](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#gps-navigation) to navigate the SID



Step 2

: Study your flight plan and/or charts, and if you wish, you can also tune any [navigation aids](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#navigation) used on the SID for extra guidance. Make sure to follow all altitude/speed restrictions, this is crucial to observe airspace restrictions, ensure terrain clearance and to maintain separation with other traffic



Tip

: If you haven't already, make sure to read the [take-off and initial climb](/guide/flying-guide/take-off-to-cruise/take-off-and-initial-climb#take-off-and-initial-climb) section before getting into the air!



Step 3

: To follow the SID once airborne, ensure that the magenta Radial Deviation Bar is inline with the magenta Course Select Pointer on your HSI



Tip

: Before making any turns, check surroundings to make sure it is clear, use the [Cameras](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/cameras#camera) and [Mini Map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#mini-map) to help you



Step 4

: As you approach the waypoint, the flight plan will automatically cycle to the next waypoint and your HSI will be reset with a new radial to follow



Step 5

: Feel overloaded? Reduce your workload by engaging the [Autopilot](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/autopilot#autopilot) and LNAV mode to get your aircraft to follow the flight plan for you



Tip

: Use caution when arming LNAV if the autopilot is engaged, the aircraft will immediately start to follow your flight plan - make sure it is clear first!



Step 6

: If ATC is active, you will be told to either contact Departure or given "Frequency Change Approved". If you are handed over to a Radar Controller and just want to follow your flight plan use the "Check In" function. The controller will respond with "Radar Contact" and you can continue as filed (the Controller may issue vectors and/or altitude assignments - ATC instructions supersede your flight plan so make sure to follow them! They will let you know when it is clear to "Continue as Filed")
