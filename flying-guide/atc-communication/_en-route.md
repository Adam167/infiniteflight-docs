# En-Route

**2. CRUISE**
During cruise , the only frequency you could contact is Center. Once in an active center frequency area, you must tune into center’s frequency.
There are two scenarios that can happen while communicating with center during cruise:**2.1 When approaching your TOD**.
Once you’re tuned to center you **must** “check in” and when you’re 1 min from your TOD request decent via XXXXX arrival and engage VNAV once you’re told to “proceed as requested” 
More informations about how to decent [Here](https://infiniteflight.com/guide/flying-guide/descent-to-landing/descent-planning)**2.2 Flying Through the airspace.**
Your destination airport isn’t in the active region and you’re just flying over it, simply “check in” and proceed on course. However if you wish to step climb you must request an altitude change. Simply click on “request altitude change” to do so.
**Keep it mind that center may vector you or give you speed/altitude instructions at any time during your flight and you MUST follow all instructions until being told to “continue as filled”.**
