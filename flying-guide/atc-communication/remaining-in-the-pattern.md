Step 3

: Select the runway you are holding short of and then tap "Remaining in the Pattern"

Step 4

: When you receive your take-off clearance (or other communication from the Controller), the Communication button will flash amber and the message will appear at the top of the screen, tap the Communication button to reply to the message

Step 5

: Once airborne you will receive a sequence and clearance as a minimum, you may also receive a pattern entry if required (e.g. due to a runway change)

## Pilot to Tower Controller Communication Tables

| Request/Message (On the Ground)              | When to Send                                                 | When Not to Send           |
| :------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| Request Departure - Departing                | The pilot should request departure if they are ready to take-off from the active runway. The direction should correlate to the direction the pilot will be departing Tower’s airspace. "In Sequence" can be included when not first in line for departure. | In any other circumstance. |
| Request Departure - Remaining in the Pattern | The pilot should state that they will be remaining in the pattern if they plan to fly patterns (take-off and land at the same airport). "In Sequence" can be included when not first in line for departure. | In any other circumstance. |
| Request Runway Crossing                      | If the pilot is with the tower controller and wishes to cross a runway, they should request permission to cross the active end. | In any other circumstance. |
| Request Frequency Change                     | The pilot should request a frequency change if they wish to change frequencies and have not yet been given a clearance to do so. | In any other circumstance. |

| Request/Message (In the Air) | When to Send                                                 | When Not to Send           |
| :--------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| Inbound for Landing          | The pilot should send this if they did not receive an approach clearance or were provided with radar vectors or flight following. | In any other circumstance. |
| Inbound on the ILS           | The pilot should call inbound on the ILS if they were cleared for an ILS approach. | In any other circumstance. |
| Inbound on the GPS           | The pilot should call inbound on the GPS if they were cleared for a GPS approach. | In any other circumstance. |
| Inbound on the Visual        | The pilot should call inbound on the visual if they were cleared for a visual approach. | In any other circumstance. |
| Announce Go Around           | Reasons to go around include an unstable approach, runway blocked by an aircraft, or loss of separation with the aircraft ahead. | In any other circumstance. |
| Request Departure            | The pilot should request departure when exiting Tower’s airspace after flying in the pattern. | In any other circumstance. |
| Report Position              | The pilot should report their position if they have not been cleared yet and are landing momentarily. | In any other circumstance. |
| Report Position - Full Stop  | The pilot can send this to inform ATC that they will be landing after flying in the pattern. | In any other circumstance. |
| Request Runway Change        | The pilot can request a runway change if they would like to change runways while in the pattern or after calling inbound. | In any other circumstance. |
| Request Transition           | If the pilot will be flying through Tower’s airspace, they should request a transition. | In any other circumstance. |
| Request Frequency Change     | The pilot should request a frequency change if they wish to change frequencies and have not yet been given a clearance to do so. | In any other circumstance. |
| Announce Missed Approach     | If the pilot’s approach is not looking right for any reason, they should announce a missed approach. | In any other circumstance. |



## Tower Controller to Pilot Communication Table

| Instruction/Message                              | ATC Intention                                                | Pilot Actions                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Cleared for Take-off                             | ATC is clearing the pilot for take-off.                      | The pilot should commence their take-off roll.               |
| Cancel Take-Off Clearance, Hold Position         | ATC is canceling the pilot's take-off clearance.             | The pilot should abort their take-off and hold on the runway. |
| Hold Short                                       | ATC wants the pilot to hold their position off the runway.   | The pilot should proceed to the hold short line and stop (the Controller may also advise the pilot of departure sequencing information). |
| Line Up and Wait                                 | ATC wants the pilot to line up on the runway and hold their position. | The pilot should enter the runway, stop, and be prepared to takeoff. |
| Back Taxi                                        | ATC wants the pilot to enter the runway and taxi to the specified end. | The pilot should taxi on the runway and, depending on the instruction, either exit and contact Ground or line up and wait. |
| Exit Runway                                      | ATC wants the pilot to exit the runway they just landed on.  | The pilot should roll off the runway and contact Ground.     |
| Exit Runway, Cross Runway XX and Contact Ground. | ATC wants the pilot to exit the runway at a controlled speed, cross Runway XX, and contact Ground. | The pilot should bring their aircraft to a safe speed, cross the specified runway, and contact Ground. No further communication with Tower is necessary. |
| Exit Runway, Hold Short of Runway XX             | ATC wants the pilot to exit the runway at a controlled speed and hold short of Runway XX. | The pilot should bring their aircraft to a controlled speed and hold short at the specified runway. They should stay with Tower; runway crossing requests are unnecessary. |
| Speed at your Discretion                         | ATC would like the pilot to manage their own speed.          | The pilot may fly at any safe speed, following speed restrictions. |
| Maintain Present Speed                           | ATC wants the pilot to maintain their current speed until told otherwise. | The pilot should check their speed and maintain that until told otherwise. |
| Maintain Slowest Practical Speed                 | ATC wants the pilot to fly as slow as is safe.               | The pilot should decrease their speed as much as possible.   |
| Maintain Best Forward Speed                      | ATC wants the pilot to fly as fast as is safe.               | The pilot should increase their speed as much as possible.   |
| Adjust Speed to Follow Aircraft Ahead            | ATC wants the pilot to slow down to maintain separation with the aircraft ahead. | The pilot should adjust their speed so that they are flying at or less than the speed of the aircraft ahead. |
