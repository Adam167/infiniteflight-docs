# Remaining in the Pattern

**Remaining in the pattern.**
Simply request departure > remaining in the pattern. If Tower tells you to **make** **right traffic** you will have to turn right after departure and opposite if tower tells you to **make** **left traffic.**
**For more informations about pattern works check this section of the user guide:**[**Pattern Entries**](https://infiniteflight.com/guide/flying-guide/descent-to-landing/pattern-entries)



If you’re remaining in the pattern, tower will clear you for the option1 and repeat until you full stop or request departure to another airport.1- “Clear for the option” means that you’re allowed to do a stop and go, a touch and go, a landing or a low pass.
