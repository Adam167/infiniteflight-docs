# Take-Off and Departure

**1.1.B Communications with Tower (Departure).**
There are many ways to request departure, there’s one for when you want to fly from a point A to a point B and one to remain on the traffic pattern of the airport.
**Departing for a full flight from a point A to B.**
When you’re ready for takeoff simply press “request departure”. You may either request departure > departing > North/East/South/West1 > Straight Out 2
1- it represents the direction you will fly when leaving the airport’s airspace I.e if your SID directs you to the south you will select south.2- Means that you will have to fly runway heading until you leave the airport’s airspace, when “straight out departures only” is on the ATIS, you must depart straight out.![img](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nW68HK17755EqnNxZ-kHE4pzMTLZvMVRwMs1r5KVPtsBz6KSi9Y8EfoHnpSkygX-FiV_dEuxrxJu3RwMVFhaJAziCKSxjV_WJdnhsai_3jBbp8n5-pNvr6YXiKfk8GEhFIfE-sMX)
**Remaining in the pattern.**
Simply request departure > remaining in the pattern. If Tower tells you to **make** **right traffic** you will have to turn right after departure and opposite if tower tells you to **make** **left traffic.**
**For more informations about pattern works check this section of the user guide:**[**Pattern Entries**](https://infiniteflight.com/guide/flying-guide/descent-to-landing/pattern-entries)
**Once Airborne**.
Once you’re airborne, wait for tower to hand you off to another frequency (approach, departure, center) or to tell you “Frequency change approve good day”. You **shouldn’t** request frequency change and **must not** switch frequency by your own this time.
If you’re remaining in the pattern, tower will clear you for the option1 and repeat until you full stop or request departure to another airport.1- “Clear for the option” means that you’re allowed to do a stop and go, a touch and go, a landing or a low pass.![img](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/mACt5MWhT5GcksnqSz2xK1qAw9YTQL6ehUujESSCW_PNoIMu8jw3rUUWCqdmFxLM4JIsW7qj29xB0YIZGWVTED--NAw-JQZabPqrGACE5PZuVUtD6M0h-FRHZy7Qs4aMFjBLedSL)![img](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/jbOQExuFxQl8Lbs5IJ4dnB3nRXknn9PxgQ-7fxibV6VrO_KHzHyuj-M7VsqR4nS2FdVEslJ1bn0SUZCyyf1qq6ExqEvC-xHlkoHzJjy89Xf5__Jw6LgoQtOIqmPI2O2EiQItJI6G)





**1.1.C Communications with Radar facilities during departure.**
Once handed off to Approach/Departure/Center from tower you must do the following :

**Check in****”Flight Following****Request approach/radar vectors****Departing with a Flight Plan filled.**YESNONO**Departing with no flight plan or for a VFR flight.**NOYESNO**Remaining in the pattern.**NONOYES
Once Center/Departure/Approach tells you “Radar contact” you’re allowed to climb to your cruise level and follow your flight plan. However Radar may vector you at any moment and you **must** follow all instructions until told to “continue as filled” (allows you follows your flight plan). While doing non-IFR flights you can proceed on course once center/approach/departure tells you to.
Note that you will have to stay with Approach or departure until FL180 or when out of the covered area, however you **must** stay tuned to center until out of center’s boundary.







**4.2 With Tower frequency.****4.2.A During departure.**
Sometimes Tower may give you progressive taxi instructions same as ground. 
Tower can also instruct you to **“line up and wait”** once you request departure. When that instruction is received you **must** line up on the runway and hold position until cleared for takeoff.
Tower can tell you to “**flight runway handing until at or above xxxx thousands feet”.** If you receive that instructions you must fly the runway heading after departure until you reach the altitude instructed or handed off to a radar frequency. You may receive this frequency when parallel departures are happening at that airport. **4.2.B During Arrival**
**Go Around without approach.****Go around with approach.****Transition.**when you’re aborting landing or instructed to go around you must stay with tower frequency and wait for further instructions to be established for landing again.Once you’re aborting landing, or instructed to go around in presence of approach, wait for tower to hand you off to approach and request an approach again.A transition is passing over an airfield without the intention to land. You can ask a transition to fly over the airfield and you will receive a minimal altitude to be at for the transition . i.e 2500 ft.



**4.3 With Approach frequency.**
**Missed approach:**
If you have a missed approach with Approach simply announce “missed approach” and you will receive new vectors for your approach.
**Hold:**Sometimes Approach may tell you to hold. When you’re asked to hold over an airport or to hold present position an hippodrome will appear on the map and you will have to do circles there until you get further instructions.
*Exemple:* **BAB** turn left heading 260 and hold over Sacramento airport at 15000ft left turns do not exceed 230 knots.
**I** **must:** hold over that airport in the hippodrome on the map at 15000ft and do right turns. I must not exceed 230 knots too.
