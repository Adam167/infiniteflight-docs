# Descent and Approach

**3. ARRIVAL****3.1 When to contact** 
You should contact ATC during your arrival at the following points depending on which frequencies are active.**CENTER****APPROACH****TOWER**When in the range/active region.50nm out at or below FL18025nm out at our below FL100.
These are the initial contacts, before switch from a frequency to another you must always wait for a hand off or a authorization to switch to another frequency.
**3.2 Arriving With Center.**
With center request decent via XXXX arrival when 1min prior to TOD or “check in” if you’re already descending. Follow all instructions until handed off to approach.**3.3 Arriving With Approach.**
When handed off to approach or when approach is your initial contact during arrival, you **must not** “check in” simply request the desired approach (ILS,Visual,GPS).Then follow all instructions or follow you’re flight plan if you’re instructed to “continue as filled”. **3.4 Arriving With Tower.**
With tower there are multiple ways to call inbound however there a specific ways to call inbound once handed off from a radar facility or once tower is your initial contact.
If you have been cleared for an ILS/Visual/GPS approach by a radar facility and have been handed off to tower:
You must click on : **Call inbound > on the ILS / VISUAL / GPS> runway ##**
**You should call inbound that way** **ONLY** **if handed off by approach and received an ILS / GPS / VISUAL approach clearance.** 
If tower is your initial contact or if you received radar vectors1
1- radar vectors means that you have been vectored to a pattern leg of the airport (downwind/base) ans handed off to tower at that point.
You must click on: **call inbound > landing >** *request specific runway* *(optional)* 
Tower will give you a pattern entry and sequence to follow if necessary and then a landing clearance.
