**STEP 1:**
Request Pushback1 and press “send” or request a specific runway2.
1- Some gates might be a direct taxi so you will have to request taxi.2- Make sure the runway you request is in the ATIS.Once cleared you can pushback.What if ATC tells me: “Pushback approved expect runway xx”.That means you will most likely be instructed to taxi to that runway and you will have to pushback on a way to taxi to that runway (left or right pushback).
**STEP 2**
When you’re ready to taxi, request taxi to **an active runway** (ATC will choose your runway depending on the ones in use) or request taxi to a **specific runway** (make sure that one is on the ATIS). ![img](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/bfuAtnijgkt5mOm0RDrvhk11eKM5sBLUaXSis-is9vOCUpJWg6W0VkrHNkjLddNc1VO9RnSyMYmEfFpDrLjjxr-gDlYTZk0CK3owVfEGVtaybRO51t0AN7ructiH5HHFVNvS2OrK)

**STEP 3**Taxi to the runway you’re assigned to and stay tuned to the ground frequency until you’re 1 aircraft to approach the hold short line. Then, simply tune to tower’s frequency **without** **requesting frequency change** (because you were already instructed to contact tower when ready).









**4.1 On ground****4.1.A Progressive Taxi Instructions.**While taxiing in or out you might revive progressive taxi instructions, which means that you will receive instructions to taxi from a point A to B instead of taxiing by your own. Before receiving progressive taxi instructions tower will tell you to “expect progressive taxi instructions”.
Example: Turn left next taxiway, Follow aircraft ahead, continue straight ahead, cross runway etc…
You **MUST** follow all instructions until instructed to “continue taxi at your discretion”, you can now continue taxi by your own.**4.1.B “Give way” instructions.**
While taxing in or out you may receive give way instructions which means that you will have to give way to another aircraft. You will have to slow down or stop to give way to the aircraft.ATC may instruct you to give way to aircraft on your left/right,ahead or exiting runway a runway.**4.1.C Runway Crossing**While Taxing you may need to cross runways sometimes. ATC may anticipate your crossing sometimes but you always **have to** request a crossing permission even if the runway is empty. To do so simply click on *“Request runway Crossing”.*
