# ATIS, Pushback and Taxi



## ATIS Communication Summary

When spawning, provided ATC is active, you will automatically be tuned to the ATIS frequency (if it is currently staffed by a Controller). The current ATIS will continue to broadcast until you tune out of the frequency.



![Tuned to ATIS](_images/manual/screens/tuned-to-atis.png)



1. As the ATIS is broadcast, it will appear at the top of the screen to show you the latest airport information.

    

2. An on screen notification will appear to inform you that you have been automatically tuned to an active frequency, you can tap it to dismiss the message.

    

3. The communication button can be tapped to change frequencies, transmit/respond to ATC messages and to view the message log.

    


![ATIS Communication Box](_images/manual/screens/atis-communication-box.png)



1. The top left corner of the communication box shows the airport ICAO code, name, frequency and elevation on the top line. The facility and frequency tuned to on the second line (if it is an active frequency); and finally the latest METAR on the third line.

    

2. The back button can be used to select other frequencies or to tune out of the current frequency.

    

3. The last altitude, heading, speed and runway assignment issued by ATC as a reminder (these will be blank until instructions are received).

   

4. This is the message log which shows all communication history, double tap it to just show your communication with ATC.

    

## ATIS Definitions

Below is a table defining the meaning of all REMARKS and NOTAMS that may be present in an ATIS broadcast:



| REMARKS                           | ATC Intention                                                | Pilot Actions                                                |
| :-------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| No Intersection Departures        | ATC require pilots to use the full length of the runway.     | The pilot should hold short at the end of the runway.        |
| No Pattern Work                   | ATC is not accepting pattern work.                           | The pilot should not attempt to fly patterns at the airport, this does not include a touch & go landing provided the pilot then departs the airspace. |
| Flow Control                      | ATC is controlling the departure rate.                       | The pilot should expect a delayed departure.                 |
| Long Taxi                         | ATC may not send departures to the closest runway.           | The pilot should expect to be sent to a runway that requires a long taxi time. |
| Gate Hold                         | ATC needs to freeze all outbound ground movement.            | The pilot should hold at their gate until the hold is lifted, do not send duplicate pushback requests. |
| No Light Aircraft                 | Light aircraft (XCub, C172, P38, SR22, and Spitfire) are not allowed in the airspace or at the airport. | The pilot, if flying a light aircraft, must divert to or respawn at a different airport. |
| Rolling Departures                | ATC would like expedited departures.                         | When cleared for takeoff, the pilot should enter the runway and begin their takeoff roll immediately. |
| Flight Plan Required              | ATC would like the pilot to file a flight plan before pushback/taxiing. | The pilot must file a flight plan before requesting pushback. |
| Straight Out Departures           | ATC would like aircraft to maintain runway heading until the altitude sent with the takeoff clearance is reached AND they are clear of traffic. | The pilot should fly straight until at the assigned altitude AND clear of all traffic before making any directional changes. |
| Multiple Frequencies in Use       | Controllers are using multiple frequencies to manage traffic. | The pilot should be ready to change frequencies at any time. |
| Check Forum for Event Information | ATC is referring pilots to special instructions on the IFC pages (i.e. FNF, VARB Summit) | The pilot should check the forum before flying.              |
| SID/STAR Use Recommended          | SID/STAR use is not essential for traffic management but is recommended. | The pilots should add a SID/STAR to their flight plan.       |
| SID/STAR Use Required             | SID/STAR use is essential for traffic management or for events and is being required. | The pilot must add an ATC preferred SID/STAR to their flight plan. |

| NOTAMS                     | ATC Intention                                     | Pilot Actions                                                |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Event in Progress          | An event is in progress.                          | The pilot may experience delays or, depending on the event, will not be allowed to participate. |
| Size Restrictions in Place | The airport cannot handle certain sized aircraft. | The pilot should think about the size of their aircraft in relation to the airport. |
| Severe Weather             | Extreme weather conditions have been reported.    | The pilot should expect high winds/turbulence.               |
| Low Visibility             | Low visibility has been reported.                 | The pilot should expect low visibility.                      |



## Pushback Communication Summary



Step 1

: Select the active Ground frequency



Step 2

: Tap "Request Pushback"



Tip

: If you are in a parking spot that does not require pushback, or in an aircraft that is not capable of pushback - then make sure to just request taxi when you are ready instead!



Step 3

: Tap "Send" or "Request Specific Runway" (if you do request a runway, the available runways will appear to select from, tap the desired runway for the request to be sent)



Tip

: If you are going to request a specific runway, make sure it is being used in the ATIS first!



Step 4

: When you receive your pushback clearance (or other communication from the Controller), the Communication symbol will flash amber and the message will appear at the top of the screen, tap the symbol to "Reply" to the message



Tip

: When you receive your pushback clearance, you may be told to expect a specific runway - this means that you will most likely be instructed to taxi to that runway when you are ready so try to pushback in a direction that allows this!



**Example:**



![Active Ground Frequency](_images/manual/screens/active-ground-frequency.png)



When you are ready for pushback you will need to contact ground, to do this select the active ground frequency.



![Request Pushback](_images/manual/screens/request-pushback.png)



The ground communication menu will appear with the option to select "request pushback".



![Send Pushback Request](_images/manual/screens/send-pushback-request.png)



You can either "send" this request (the amber arrow signifies that it is the last option before the message will send) or you can "request specific runway"



![Reply to Pushback Clearance](_images/manual/screens/reply-to-pushback-clearance.png)



When the ATC response is received, tap the Communication symbol to "Reply" to the Controller

| Communication    | When to Send                                                 | When Not to Send                                             |
| :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Request Pushback | When the pilot wishes to pushback, they should request a pushback clearance. | This should not be requested if the user is piloting an aircraft without pushback capabilities (C172, C208, TBM-930, SR22, XCub, F18, F22, F16, F14, A-10, Spitfire, or P-38) or is in a parking space that does not require a pushback. |

## Taxi Instruction Definitions



**STEP 2**
When you’re ready to taxi, request taxi to **an active runway** (ATC will choose your runway depending on the ones in use) or request taxi to a **specific runway** (make sure that one is on the ATIS). 

**STEP 3**Taxi to the runway you’re assigned to and stay tuned to the ground frequency until you’re 1 aircraft to approach the hold short line. Then, simply tune to tower’s frequency **without** **requesting frequency change** (because you were already instructed to contact tower when ready).



**4.1 On ground****4.1.A Progressive Taxi Instructions.**While taxiing in or out you might revive progressive taxi instructions, which means that you will receive instructions to taxi from a point A to B instead of taxiing by your own. Before receiving progressive taxi instructions tower will tell you to “expect progressive taxi instructions”.
Example: Turn left next taxiway, Follow aircraft ahead, continue straight ahead, cross runway etc…
You **MUST** follow all instructions until instructed to “continue taxi at your discretion”, you can now continue taxi by your own.**4.1.B “Give way” instructions.**
While taxing in or out you may receive give way instructions which means that you will have to give way to another aircraft. You will have to slow down or stop to give way to the aircraft.ATC may instruct you to give way to aircraft on your left/right,ahead or exiting runway a runway.**4.1.C Runway Crossing**While Taxing you may need to cross runways sometimes. ATC may anticipate your crossing sometimes but you always **have to** request a crossing permission even if the runway is empty. To do so simply click on *“Request runway Crossing”.*
