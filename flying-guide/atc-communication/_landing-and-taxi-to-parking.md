# Landing and Taxi to Parking

**3.5 After Landing**.
Once you have landed you will receive a runway exit instruction. Here are the possible exit instructions and what you should do:
Exit runway when able contact ground on the taxiway 
This allows you to exit the runway by a left or right exit and directly switch to ground’s frequency without needing to request frequency change. 
When able turn left contact ground on the taxiway.
Same as above however you must turn **left** while exiting the runway or opposite if instructed to turn right. 
Exit runway left/right cross runway xx and contact ground.
Same as above however this time you must cross the specific runway prior to contacting ground. 
Exit runway hold short of runway xx.
Once you’re off the runway you should hold short of the specific runway instructed by ATC (example you landed on 28L and you’re instructed to exit and hold short of 28R). **You must not switch** to ground this time and must wait for ATC to clear you to cross the runway and hand you off to ground once you’re clear of all runways.**3.6 Taxing to parking.**
Once you’ve tuned to the ground frequency click on “request taxi” > “Parking” and you’re done ! 
You now know all basics communication for a realistic and good flight from a point A to B.
