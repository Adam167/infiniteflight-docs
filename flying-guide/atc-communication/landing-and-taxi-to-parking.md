# Landing and Taxi to Parking



## Landing Communication Summary



Step 1

: Select the active Tower frequency



Step 2

: Tap "Call Inbound"



![Call Inbound](_images/manual/frames/call-inbound.jpg)



Step 3

: Select your intention (either "Landing" or "Touch and Go")



![Intention](_images/manual/frames/intention.jpg)



Step 4

: The following options will then be displayed:



| Communication           | When to Send                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Send                    | When not cleared for an approach by a Radar Controller       |
| Request Specific Runway | When not cleared for an approach by a Radar Controller       |
| On the ILS              | After being cleared for the ILS Approach by a Radar Controller |
| On the GPS              | After being cleared for the GPS Approach by a Radar Controller |
| On the Visual           | After being cleared for the Visual Approach by a Radar Controller |

Step 5

: If any option other than "Send" is selected, you will then be given the option to select the runway. Make sure to send the runway assignment that was issued when cleared by Radar (or if no Radar Controller was present, send the runway that is in use for landing and/or is most suitable based on your position)



![Send](_images/manual/frames/send.jpg)



Step 6

: Based on the inbound call sent, will determine what response the Tower Controller will respond with:



| Communication Sent      | Response from Tower                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Send                    | Pattern Entry, Sequence (if required), Number [sequence] Cleared to [Land/For the Option] |
| Request Specific Runway | Pattern Entry, Sequence (if required), Number [sequence] Cleared to [Land/For the Option] |
| On the ILS              | Number [sequence] Cleared to [Land/For the Option]           |
| On the GPS              | Number [sequence] Cleared to [Land/For the Option]           |
| On the Visual           | Sequence (if required), Number [sequence] Cleared to [Land/For the Option] |



![Sent](_images/manual/frames/sent.jpg)



Step 7

: When you receive your clearance (or other communication from the Controller), the Communication button will flash amber and the message will appear at the top of the screen, tap the Communication button to "Reply" to the message

## Taxi to Parking Communication Summary



Step 1

: After landing, expeditiously exit the runway in a controller manner. The exit transmission may also include which direction to exit, and hold shot/crossing instructions for other runways



![Runway Exit Instruction](_images/manual/frames/runway-exit-instruction.jpg)



Step 2

: When you are able to, tap the Communication button and reply to the message sent by the Tower Controller (this may include an instruction to "Contact Ground")



![Wilco](_images/manual/frames/wilco.jpg)



Step 3

: If you have been given permission to change frequency, tap the back arrow in the Communication Tab, then select the Ground frequency 



![Contact Ground](_images/manual/frames/contact-ground.jpg)



Tip

: Make sure that you clear the runway completely before contacting Ground - don't forget, you do not need to come to a complete stop, try to keep moving for efficiency!



Step 4

: Once you have changed frequency, tap "Request Taxi" and then "Parking"



![Request Taxi to Parking](_images/manual/frames/request-taxi-to-parking.jpg)



Step 5

: : When taxi instructions are received (or other communication from the Controller), the Communication button will flash amber and the message will appear at the top of the screen, tap the Communication button to "Reply" to the message

| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Request Taxi to an Active Runway  | Sent when the pilot does not have a runway preference.       | The pilot should not send this when they are actively pushing back. |
| Request Taxi to a Specific Runway | Sent when the pilot has a runway preference.                 | The pilot should not request an inactive runway, determined by the current ATIS. |
| Request Pushback                  | When the pilot wishes to pushback, they should request a pushback clearance. | This should not be requested if the user is piloting an aircraft without pushback capabilities (C172, C208, TBM-930, SR22, XCub, F18, F22, F16, F14, A-10, Spitfire, or P-38) or is in a parking space that does not require a pushback. |
| Request Runway Crossing           | If the pilot's taxi route requires them to cross a runway, they must request permission to cross. The requested runway should be the same as the runway in use. | In any other circumstance.                                   |
| Request Frequency Change          | The pilot should request a frequency change if they wish to change frequencies and have not yet been given a clearance to do so. | The pilot should not request a frequency change from Ground when they are taxiing to a runway. The frequency change is included in the taxi instruction (“contact Tower when ready”). |

| Make a 180                               | ATC wants the pilot to make a 180º turn.                     | The pilot should turn around and await further instructions. |
| Follow Aircraft Ahead                    | ATC wants the pilot to follow the aircraft ahead.            | The pilot should follow the aircraft ahead until given further instructions. |
