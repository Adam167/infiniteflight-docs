Step 2

: Tune to the active frequency and request pushback **Insert hyperlink to ‘Pilot User Interface – Communication’**, or if there is no active ATC, tune to the Unicom frequency – listen for traffic before starting your pushback

Use the Cameras **Insert hyperlink to ‘Pilot User Interface – Cameras’** and Mini Map **Insert hyperlink to ‘Pilot User Interface – Mini Map’** throughout the pushback and the Rudder **Insert hyperlink to ‘Pilot User Interface – Flight Controls’** to move the aircraft

 

Step 5

: When you’re ready to stop the pushback, access the Systems **Insert hyperlink to ‘Pilot User Interface – Systems’** menu and select the following:

## Engine Start

 

Engine start can commence during or after the push back.

## Trim and Flaps

 

Before you’re ready to taxi, you need to set your Trim and Flaps **Insert hyperlink to ‘Pilot User Interface – Flight Controls’** for take-off. Press and hold on each of them until you have the desired setting.



## Taxi, Rudder and Brakes

 

Step 1

: Check surroundings to make sure it is clear, use the Cameras **Insert hyperlink to ‘Pilot User Interface – Cameras’** and Mini Map **Insert hyperlink to ‘Pilot User Interface – Mini Map’** to help you

 

Step 2

: Request taxi **Insert hyperlink to ‘Pilot User Interface – Communication’** with the active ATC, or if there is no active ATC, announce taxi on the Unicom frequency – listen out whilst you’re on the move for other traffic

 

Step 3

: Release the Park Brake **Insert hyperlink to ‘Pilot User Interface – Flight Controls’** and increase Power **Insert hyperlink to ‘Pilot User Interface – Head Up Display (HUD)’** to start the taxi

 

Tip

:   We recommend you do not exceed 40% N1 whilst taxiing, and once you’ve started to move, you typically don’t need more than idle power!

 

Step 4

: Use the Rudder **Insert hyperlink to ‘Pilot User Interface – Flight Controls’** to maintain the taxiway centreline and either the Rud Brakes or Park Brake **Insert hyperlink to ‘Pilot User Interface – Flight Controls’** to keep your speed under control

 

Tip

:   Do not exceed 35kts groundspeed to avoid in game violations, we recommend you keep you speed below 25kts in a straight line and 10kts or less during 90° turns for a safe operation.

 

Step 5

: If you need to cross a runway whilst taxiing, make sure to request runway crossing **Insert hyperlink to ‘Pilot User Interface – Communication’** with the active ATC, or if there is no active ATC, announce crossing on the Unicom frequency – always check it’s clear before you enter the runway! Don’t forget to access the Systems **Insert hyperlink to ‘Pilot User Interface – Systems’** menu and select the following:
