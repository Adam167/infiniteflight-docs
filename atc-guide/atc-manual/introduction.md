# Introduction

 

### 1.1.1

This guide is designed to help new entrants and current controllers with IFATC procedures, as well as cover the fundamental principles associated with all controlling facilities on Infinite Flight. **All controllers are expected to familiarise themselves with this guide and continue to do so during their time with IFATC.**



### 1.1.2   

 The IFATC Tutorials on the Infinite Flight Community (IFC) Channels and FAA 7110.65 are additional tools that controllers **should** utilise.



### 1.1.3    

Feedback on this manual is welcome and should be sent to @RAH via the IFC or the IFATC Slack.



### 1.1.4    

A site designed by one of our controllers and is dedicated to help with controlling can be found by clicking this link [https://www.ifatc.org/](https://www.ifatc.org/). The features are extensive and updated regularly, thus are not covered within this manual but controllers **should** utilise the tools this site offers.
