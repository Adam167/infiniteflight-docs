 

# New Entrants

 

***TOP TIP: All controllers\*** ***must\*** ***ensure that their IFC Username, Slack Display Name, and IF Display Name have a measure of consistency so that they can easily be found if required (see 2.2.1 below)\***

 

## 2.1  Slack Communication Guidelines

 

### 2.1.1    

Slack is a messenger app for teams to make work simpler, more pleasant and more productive. Please visit https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us to learn more about how this app works.



### 2.1.2    

Group chats are authorized as long as they do not diminish effectiveness of primary channels. Controllers are encouraged to utilize group messages or threads for specific interest groups amongst controllers. Slack rules will still be enforced if an issue is brought to the attention of a Supervisor or above.

 

### 2.1.3   

 The channels and their use is outlined in the table below:

 

| **Channel**    | **Purpose**                                                  |
| -------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| #controllers   | All normal controller communications to occur  in this channel. This channel **should** **not** be used unless ***ACTIVELY\***  controlling. |
| #discussions   | A space for mature dialogue about Infinite  Flight and aviation related topics for active controllers. Moderate off topic  conversation is acceptable but **should** be kept to a minimum. |
| #readonly      | News, updates and important team  announcements to be made on this channel by the ATC Community Manager and  Moderators only. Controllers **must not** reply to  any material posted in this channel so that all controllers can be reached  effectively. |
| #flights       | This channel will be used for controllers to  coordinate group flights together. All coordination **should** remain in this channel. |
| #issues        | Any issues that occur that specifically  involve controlling **should** be placed in this channel with the  following information included:  -      Specific issue  -      UTC time issue occurred  -      Pilot username / callsign involved  -      Controller username  -      ATC facility |
| #training-time | Trainers  will post in this channel when they require pilots to join in for training  sessions, the relevant instructions are pinned within the channel. |

 

## 2.2  General Rules

 

### 2.2.1    

The following rules **must** be followed at all times:

 

|                          **Slack**                           |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| Your Slack username **must** remain consistent. Please use  your first name, if able. |
| Controllers **must not** share any IFATC material or conversations contained  within the IFATC Slack externally (unless prior approval has been granted). |
| Be respectful to other users and refrain from  profanity & offensive dialogue (including, but not limited to; racist and  sexual comments). |
| Criticism and feedback will generally be  given via DM; however, on occasion, it may be provided publicly if it is  deemed to be a wider issue amongst controllers. |
| Off topic material,  including memes and GIFs, **must not** be used  outside of the #discussions channel. |



|                       **Controlling**                        |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| All controllers **must** announce  in #controllers when opening/closing any frequency on the Expert Server. When closing, a ***MINIMUM\*** of 5 minutes warning and the last ATIS letter used  **must**  be provided. |
| Controllers **must**  control within the bounds of the ATC Schedule posted every week on the IFC  and in #readonly on Slack. The only exception to this is when controllers are  not qualified to do so as per the rank structure *(see 2.4.1 below)*, in which case a sensible alternative can be  selected. |
| Opening frequencies is on a first come, first serve  basis within #controllers. Therefore controllers **should not** reserve frequencies  privately or not open in anticipation of a particular frequency becoming  available. This does not apply to certain events where frequency allocation  may be authorised. |
| Controllers **must not** control on the Training Server *(see 11.4.3  below for exceptions).* |
| Controllers **must not** act as a controller and as a pilot simultaneously  on separate devices, violating Infinite Flight’s Terms & Agreement. |
| Standards of  controlling are closely monitored – **controllers are expected to control within their means,  prioritising quality over quantity** *(see 2.4 below)* |

 

## 2.3  Slack Slash Commands

 

***TOP TIP: ALL controllers\*** ***must\*** ***run the /deletion Slack slash command regularly to delete files, this helps to prevent the IFATC Slack storage from becoming full\***

 

### 2.3.1    

Slash commands allow a user to type a keyword using the following format: ‘/<command>’

 

### 2.3.2    

Below are some of the commands that can be used:

 

**/atc** – shows all open frequencies

**/away** – sets your Slack status to “away”

**/deletion** – shows you how to delete your files, this **must** be done ***REGULARLY\***

**/descent [altitude to lose] [groundspeed]** – provides descent guidance when flying

**/gmt** – provides the current (local) time in GMT

**/livestatus** – provides a link to the IFATC facility status page

**/metar [KSSC]** – shows the current, live METAR information for a selected airport

**/mystats** – search for your IFATC statistics

**/open [channel]** – opens the specified channel

**/reference** – provides a link to the folder that contains this document

**/remind** – allows you to set helpful reminders

**/training** – provides a link to the current training schedule 

 

## 2.4  Rank Structure

 

***TOP TIP: When you are promoted you will have access to airports that typically have more traffic. It is encouraged that you start off slowly, gradually building up to these more ‘high-volume’ traffic airports within your new classification. This is particularly important during peak times or events such as Friday Night Flight (FNF). If in doubt, ask in #controllers for suggestions before opening – it takes time to get use to heavy traffic, start off SLOWLY\*** 

 

### 2.4.1    

The table below outlines the Rank Structure in place. Promotion is based on activity, performance, feedback and in some cases, a formal test (theory and/or practical).

 

| **Rank**       | **Frequencies  Available** | **Test  Required**              |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Apprentice     | C / D / ATIS               | Theory and Practical (Initial)  |
| Specialist*    | B / C / D / ATIS           | Practical (Check Ride)          |
| Officer**      | Radar / B / C / D / ATIS   | Theory and Practical (Radar)*** |
| Supervisor**** | Radar / B / C / D / ATIS   | No                              |

\* On promotion to Specialist, controllers are placed on probation until the ‘check ride’ phase is completed *(see 11.4 below)*.

** A minimum probation period of 30 days assigned on promotion to Officer *(see 11.4.6 below).*

*** Minimum of 60 days at the rank of Specialist and 2000 total operations before commencing training for the rank of Officer – do not contact a Recruiter for radar training before you meet the minimum requirements *(see 11.4 below).*

**** Supervisors are able to control multiple Radar frequencies as well as Tower and Ground frequencies – simultaneously.

 

### 2.4.2    

All controllers have the ability to issue a Violation once they have been added to IFATC. Guidelines are contained within this manual *(see 3.1 below).*



### 2.4.3    

'Recruiters’ are authorised to invigilate all Theory and Practical tests *(see 11.1.2 below)* in addition to the rank privileges of Supervisor.



### 2.4.4     

‘Trainers’ are authorised to conduct training for all Practical tests *(see 11.1.3 below)* in addition to the rank privileges of either Officer or Supervisor (dependant on their position within IFATC).



### 2.4.5    

**All controllers are subject to promotion/demotion at any time based on activity, performance and feedback.**

 

## 2.5  Disciplinary and Suspension Procedure

 

### 2.5.1    

Controllers not following Slack Communication Guidelines and Rules can expect the following procedure:

 

\-    1st Offense:       Warning via DM

\-    2nd Offense:            3 day controller & Slack suspension

\-    3rd Offense:      7 day controller & Slack suspension

\-    4th Offense:      Removal from the IFATC Team

 

### 2.5.2    

Serious cases, reviewed by Moderators, are subject to immediate removal or suspension.
