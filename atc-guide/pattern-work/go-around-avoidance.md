# Go-Around Avoidance



| Scenario                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Both *N1DC* and *I-DRUM* are on final for RWY05L. With minimum separation and an Approach Speed difference in excess of 80kts, the possibility of a go-around is high |

| Technique 1                                                  | Pros / Cons                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Try to anticipate the problem by creating separation sooner rather than later | {.tick} Could prevent a go-around |
| E.g. if both aircraft were downwind, rather than allowing *I-DRUM* to follow *N1DC* with minimum separation, you could instruct *I-DRUM* to "extend downwind, I'll call your base" to build more separation in between the two aircraft | {.cross} May increase workload    |

| Technique 2                                                  | Pros / Cons                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Instruct *I-DRUM* to "maintain slowest practical speed"      | {.tick} Could prevent a go-around                            |
| Once *N1DC* has landed and is at a sensible speed, you can instruct them to exit the runway expeditiously (if it is a full-stop) | {.cross} May cause separation issues with other aircraft on final |

| Technique 3                                                  | Pros / Cons                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| If you have multiple runways available, you could change the runway that *I-DRUM* is cleared for | {.tick} Good use of all available runways                |
| Instruct *I-DRUM* to "enter straight in RWY 05R"             | {.cross} May increase Pilot workload and cause confusion |
| Re-clear *I-DRUM* for RWY05R with the appropriate traffic pattern instruction if it is a touch & go |                                                          |

Tip

: There is nothing wrong with a go-around but it is the final defence - if you can prevent this by being proactive then great!
