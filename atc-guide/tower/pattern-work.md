# Pattern Work



## Pattern Entry and Sequencing



Manual

: When there is no Radar Controller present, Tower **must**{.red} issue a pattern entry and clearance to **ALL**{.red} aircraft as a **MINIMUM**{.red}, regardless of what the aircraft uses to check in on the Tower frequency - the use of sequencing will be dependent on traffic



| Scenario                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Multiple aircraft have just announced inbound but the Controller is unsure on what order to sequence them in |

{.scenario}

| Technique 1                                                  | Pros / Cons                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Only send a pattern entry to the aircraft you are unsure about in terms of sequencing | {.tick} Offers flexibility                                   |
| Wait until the aircraft are closer, and once certain of their sequence, issue this along with their clearance | {.tick} Ensures aircraft know who they are following         |
|                                                              | {.cross} May increase workload as you have to send two separate commands |

{.technique}

| Technique 2                                                  | Pros / Cons                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Send a pattern entry and the most likely sequence to all aircraft | {.tick} Good for workload management                         |
| Monitor and if required, change the sequence as they get closer | {.cross} Aircraft may be unsure who they are following if the sequence is given too early |

{.technique}



Tip

: Keep working from the inside out, make sure that aircraft closest to the airport have been given a pattern entry and clearance as a minimum (and a sequence if it is required). Then progressively work your way to all the aircraft further out!



## Spacing Maneuvers

| Scenario                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *I-DRUM* and *N1DC* have both already been sequenced and cleared for RWY05L, but as both aircraft continue downwind, it becomes clear that *I-DRUM* will be doing wider patterns than *N1DC* |

{.scenario}

![Spacing Maneuvers](_images/manual/frames/atcg-pw-downwind.jpg)

| Technique 1                                                  | Pros / Cons                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Re-clear *N1DC* as number 1                                  | {.tick} Efficient                                            |
| Re-sequence *I-DRUM* as number 2                             | {.tick} Greater Pilot satisfaction                           |
| If you are concerned about separation, you can tell *I-DRUM* to "extend downwind, I'll call your base" to alleviate this | {.cross} May increase workload as you have to send various commands |

{.technique}

| Technique 2                                                  | Pros / Cons                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| In addition to Technique 1, when re-clearing *N1DC* as number 1, you could give them the opposite traffic pattern | {.tick} Offers flexibility                           |
|                                                              | {.cross} May cause confusion on who is following who |

{.technique}



## Runway Changes



Manual

: If a runway change is issued, a new pattern entry and clearance **must**{.red} be given (the use of sequencing will be dependent on traffic).



| Scenario                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *VP-MAX* is departing RWY32L and *I F A E Eleven* is departing RWY32R. Both departures happened simultaneously. *I F A E Eleven* then asks for a RWY change to RWY32L |

{.scenario}

![Runway Changes](_images/manual/frames/atcg-pw-runway-change.jpg)

| Technique 1                                                  | Pros / Cons                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Instruct *I F A E Eleven* to "enter right downwind RWY32L, number 2, traffic to follow is on left downwind” | {.tick} Offers flexibility                           |
| If you are concerned about a conflict on the other end, then you can also tell *I F A E Eleven* to "extend downwind, I'll call your base" to alleviate this | {.cross} May cause confusion on who is following who |
| When you clear *I F A E Eleven*, you can then give them left traffic if you wish to do so to move them onto that side for subsequent patterns |                                                      |

{.technique}

| Technique 2                                                  | Pros / Cons                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Instruct *VP-MAX* to "turn crosswind”                        | {.tick} Ensures separation between both aircraft             |
| When you are happy with the separation, tell *I F A E Eleven* to "enter left downwind for RWY32L, number 2, traffic to follow is on left downwind” | {.cross} *I F A E Eleven* may start the turn onto a right downwind before you have time to give the new pattern entry |
| If during this time, *I F A E Eleven* starts a right turn for RWY32R, then adopt Technique 1 instead |                                                              |

{.technique}

| Technique 3                                                  | Pros / Cons                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Instruct *I F A E Eleven* "extend upwind, I'll call your crosswind” | {.tick} Prevents *I F A E Eleven* from entering right downwind |
| Wait until separation between *VP-MAX* and *I F A E Eleven* is adequate (you can expedite this by telling *VP-MAX* to "turn crosswind"), and then tell *I F A E Eleven* to "enter left downwind for RWY32L, number 2, traffic to follow is on left downwind” | {.cross} May add confusion when a pattern entry is used instead of "turn crosswind" |
| The new pattern entry supersedes the previous instruction    |                                                              |

{.technique}



Tip

: Remember that other variables (such as terrain) might influence what is the best technique to use on the day, be flexible! 



## Avoiding a Go-Around



| Scenario                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Both *N1DC* and *I-DRUM* are on final for RWY05L. With minimum separation and an Approach Speed difference in excess of 80kts, the possibility of a go-around is high |

{.scenario}

![Avoiding a Go-Around](_images/manual/frames/atcg-pw-go-around.jpg)

| Technique 1                                                  | Pros / Cons                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| When aircraft have large Approach Speed differences, larger separation may be required on final to alleviate this | {.tick} Could prevent a go-around |
| If you are concerned about a conflict, you could instruct *I-DRUM* to "extend downwind, I'll call your base" to build more separation in between the two aircraft | {.cross} May increase workload    |

{.technique}

| Technique 2                                                  | Pros / Cons                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Instruct *I-DRUM* to "maintain slowest practical speed"      | {.tick} Could prevent a go-around                            |
| Once *N1DC* has landed and is at a sensible speed, you can instruct them to exit the runway expeditiously (if it is a full-stop) | {.cross} May cause separation issues with other aircraft on final |

{.technique}

| Technique 3                                                  | Pros / Cons                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| If you have multiple runways available, you could change the runway that *I-DRUM* is cleared for | {.tick} Good use of all available runways                |
| Instruct *I-DRUM* to "enter straight in RWY 05R"             | {.cross} May increase Pilot workload and cause confusion |
| Re-clear *I-DRUM* for RWY05R with the appropriate traffic pattern instruction if it is a touch & go |                                                          |

{.technique}



Tip

: There is nothing wrong with a go-around but it is the final defence - if you can prevent this by being proactive then great!
