# Pattern Work



| Scenario                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Aircraft 1 is departing RWY32L and Aircraft 2 is departing RWY32R. Both departures happened simultaneously. Aircraft 2 then asks for a RWY change to RWY32L |

{.scenario}

| Technique 1                                                  | Pros / Cons                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Instruct Aircraft 2 to "enter right downwind RWY32L, number 2, traffic to follow is on left downwind” | {.tick} Offers flexibility                           |
| If you are concerned about a conflict on the other end, then you can also tell aircraft 2 that you will "call their base" to alleviate this | {.cross} May cause confusion on who is following who |
| When you clear Aircraft 2, you can then give them left traffic if you wish to do so to move them onto that side for subsequent patterns |                                                      |

| Technique 2                                                  | Pros / Cons                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Instruct Aircraft 1 to "turn crosswind”                      | {.tick} Ensures separation between both aircraft             |
| When you are happy with the separation, simply tell Aircraft 2 to "enter left downwind for RWY32L, number 2, traffic to follow is on left downwind” | {.cross} Aircraft 2 may start the turn onto a right downwind before you have time to give the new pattern entry |
| If during this time, Aircraft 2 starts a right turn for RWY32R, then adopt Technique 1 instead |                                                              |

| Technique 3                                                  | Pros / Cons                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Instruct Aircraft 2 to "extend upwind, you'll call their crosswind” | {.tick} Prevents Aircraft 2 from entering right downwind     |
| Wait until separation between Aircraft 1 and 2 is adequate (you can expedite this by telling Aircraft 1 to "turn crosswind"), and then tell Aircraft 2 to "enter left downwind for RWY32L, number 2, traffic to follow is on left downwind” | {.cross} May add confusion when a pattern entry is used instead of "turn crosswind" |
| The new pattern entry supersedes the previous instruction    |                                                              |

━━━━━[TIPS]━━━━━

- Whilst all techniques are fine, I would suggest that Technique 1 offers the greatest flexibility, you do not need to have all aircraft on RWY32L in the left pattern, and all aircraft on RWY32R in the right pattern. For example, if Aircraft 2 turned out to be faster on downwind, you could then re-clear them as number 1 and sequence Aircraft 1 behind them, this might not be possible if they are both on the same side (i.e. left downwind)
- There may be a reason that it is not appropriate to use a particular side of the pattern due to traffic/terrain or something else. Therefore one day, Technique 1 might be the best, and the next, Technique 2 or 3
- Remember that these are **techniques** - they are deliberately *"grey"* rather than *"black & white"* rules. And as such, following a session; it might be more of a *"did you think about this as an option instead?"* or *"do you think there were any other ways you could have handled that situation?"*. Technique 3 may seem like the easiest "fail safe" method, but it is important to be flexible and utilize the technique that is best suited to the situation! 







Manual

: When there is no Radar Controller present, Tower **must**{.red} issue a pattern entry and clearance to **ALL**{.red} aircraft as a **MINIMUM**{.red}, regardless of what the aircraft uses to check in on the Tower frequency - the use of sequencing will be dependent on traffic



Notes:

- how to integrate transitions into the pattern
- who should go first when you have a bunch of inbounds, how to determine that, work inside out 
- re-sequencing such as runway changes (someone extending downwind too far, and then the person behind could be re-sequences but the controller just makes them all continue)
- workload management (managing the ground and tower at the same time), ground awareness
- two aircraft at the same altitude that want a transition, how to manage
- planning, how to plan, what the pattern work altitudes will be , what altitude will people need to be at for the transition, weather limitations, over 10kts for weather etc
- runway changes
