# Pattern Work / Transitions / Flight of XX



## Pattern Work



+++ SCENARIO - Re-Sequencing

| Scenario                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *I-DRUM* and *N1DC* have both already been sequenced and cleared for RWY05L. As both aircraft continue downwind, *I-DRUM* has gone further downwind than the Controller expected |

{.scenario}

| Technique 1                                                  | Pros / Cons                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Re-clear *N1DC* as number 1                                  | {.tick} Efficient                                            |
| Re-sequence *I-DRUM* as number 2                             | {.tick} Greater Pilot satisfaction                           |
| If you are concerned about separation, you can tell *I-DRUM* to "extend downwind, I'll call your base" to alleviate this | {.cross} May increase workload as you have to send various commands |

{.technique}

| Technique 2                                       | Pros / Cons                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Instruct *I-DRUM* to "turn base"                  | {.tick} Can be efficient                                     |
| This will force *I-DRUM* to fly a tighter pattern | {.cross} Some aircraft may not be able to fly as tight a pattern |
