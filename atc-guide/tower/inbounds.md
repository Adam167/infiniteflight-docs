# Inbounds



## Pattern Entry, Sequence and Clearance



![The Traffic Pattern](_images/manual/graphics/atc-traffic-pattern.jpg)



Manual

: When there is no Radar Controller present, Tower **must**{.red} issue a pattern entry and clearance to **ALL**{.red} aircraft as a **MINIMUM**{.red}, regardless of what the aircraft uses to check in on the Tower frequency - the use of sequencing will be dependent on traffic.

+++ SCENARIO - Multiple Inbounds

| Scenario                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Multiple aircraft have just announced inbound but the Controller is unsure on what order to sequence them in |

{.scenario}

![Pattern Entry and Sequencing](_images/manual/frames/atcg-pw-inbound.jpg)

| Technique 1                                                  | Pros / Cons                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Only send a pattern entry to the aircraft you are unsure about in terms of sequencing | {.tick} Offers flexibility                                   |
| Wait until the aircraft are closer, and once certain of their sequence, issue this along with their clearance | {.tick} Ensures aircraft know who they are following         |
|                                                              | {.cross} May increase workload as you have to send two separate commands |

{.technique}

| Technique 2                                                  | Pros / Cons                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Send a pattern entry and the most likely sequence to all aircraft | {.tick} Good for workload management                         |
| Monitor and if required, change the sequence as they get closer | {.cross} Aircraft may be unsure who they are following if the sequence is given too early |

{.technique}



Tip

: Work from the inside out by making sure that all aircraft closest to the airport have been given a pattern entry, sequence (unless they are number 1) and clearance. Then progressively work your way out to all the other aircraft!

## Runway Changes



Manual

: If a runway change is issued, a new pattern entry and clearance **must**{.red} be given (the use of sequencing will be dependent on traffic).



+++ SCENARIO - Runway Changes

| Scenario                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *VP-MAX* is departing RWY32L and *I F A E Eleven* is departing RWY32R. Both departures happened simultaneously. *I F A E Eleven* then asks for a RWY change to RWY32L |

{.scenario}

![Runway Changes](_images/manual/frames/atcg-pw-runway-change.jpg)

| Technique 1                                                  | Pros / Cons                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Instruct *I F A E Eleven* to "enter right downwind RWY32L, number 2, traffic to follow is on left downwind” | {.tick} Offers flexibility                           |
| If you are concerned about a conflict on the other end, then you can also tell *I F A E Eleven* to "extend downwind, I'll call your base" to alleviate this | {.cross} May cause confusion on who is following who |
| When you clear *I F A E Eleven*, you can then give them left traffic if you wish to do so to move them onto that side for subsequent patterns |                                                      |

{.technique}

| Technique 2                                                  | Pros / Cons                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Instruct *VP-MAX* to "turn crosswind”                        | {.tick} Ensures separation between both aircraft             |
| When you are happy with the separation, tell *I F A E Eleven* to "enter left downwind for RWY32L, number 2, traffic to follow is on left downwind” | {.cross} *I F A E Eleven* may start the turn onto a right downwind before you have time to give the new pattern entry |
| If during this time, *I F A E Eleven* starts a right turn for RWY32R, then adopt Technique 1 instead |                                                              |

{.technique}

| Technique 3                                                  | Pros / Cons                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Instruct *I F A E Eleven* "extend upwind, I'll call your crosswind” | {.tick} Prevents *I F A E Eleven* from entering right downwind |
| Wait until separation between *VP-MAX* and *I F A E Eleven* is adequate (you can expedite this by telling *VP-MAX* to "turn crosswind"), and then tell *I F A E Eleven* to "enter left downwind for RWY32L, number 2, traffic to follow is on left downwind” | {.cross} May add confusion when a pattern entry is used instead of "turn crosswind" |
| The new pattern entry supersedes the previous instruction    |                                                              |

Tip

: Remember that other variables (such as terrain) might influence what is the best technique to use on the day, be flexible!
