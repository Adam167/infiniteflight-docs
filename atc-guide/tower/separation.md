Manual

: The table below outlines the separation requirements that **must**{.red} be applied to **ALL**{.red} aircraft:

| Type                  | Rule                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Departure / Departure | The first aircraft **must**{.red} be airborne before the second aircraft* commences the take-off roll |
| Arrival / Arrival     | The first aircraft **must**{.red} be clear of the runway edge (not the hold short line) before the second aircraft crosses the threshold |
| Departure / Arrival   | The first aircraft **must**{.red} be airborne before the second aircraft crosses the threshold |
| Arrival / Departure   | The first aircraft **must**{.red} be clear of the runway edge (not the hold short line) before the second aircraft commences the take-off roll |
| Intersecting          | Arriving/departing aircraft **must**{.red} be beyond the runway intersection prior to a departure beginning it's take-off roll or an arrival crossing the threshold on an intersecting runway. Consideration **should**{.red} also be given to the extended centerline of runways, where the runway does not physically intersect, but aircraft flight paths would during take-off and landing. In these cases the same separation criteria **should**{.red} be afforded |
