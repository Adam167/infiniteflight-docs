# 1A.3  Rank Structure

 

Tip

: When you are promoted you will have access to airports that typically have more traffic. It is encouraged that you start off slowly, gradually building up to these more "high-volume" traffic airports within your new classification. This is particularly important during peak times or events such as Friday Night Flight (FNF). If in doubt, ask in *#controllers* for suggestions before opening â€“ it takes time to get use to heavy traffic, start off **SLOWLY**{.red}

 

### 1A.3.1    

The table below outlines the Rank Structure in place. Promotion is based on activity, performance, feedback and in some cases, a formal test (theory and/or practical).

 

| Rank        | Frequencies Available    | Test Required                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Apprentice  | C / D / ATIS             | Theory and Practical (Initial)  |
| Specialist* | B / C / D / ATIS         | Practical (Check Ride)          |
| Officer**   | Radar / B / C / D / ATIS | Theory and Practical (Radar)*** |

\* On promotion to Specialist, Controllers are placed on probation until the "Check Ride" phase is completed *(see [7.4](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.4-promotion-to-specialist-(check-ride)#7.4-promotion-to-specialist-(check-ride)) below)*.

** A minimum probation period of 30 days assigned on promotion to Officer *(see [7.5.7](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.5-radar-theory-and-practical-tests#7.5.7) below).*

*** Before commencement of training for the rank of Officer, the following requirements must be met (do not contact a recruiter for Radar Training before you meet the mimimum requirements):



- Minimum of 60 days at the rank of Specialist
- Minimum of 2000 all-time operations
- Attend a minimum of 10 training sessions per 30 days in the *#training-time[1-3]* Discord channels (this is counted with the honor system and members are expected to track their own attendance)
- Maintain a minimum of 35%/31.5 days activity in a 90 day period to qualify for training services (this % will be shown on each user's activity profile at [https://if-atc.com](https://if-atc.com))



In addition to the rank structure outlined above, further roles within IFATC are outlined below:



| Title      | Role                                     | Violation Reversals               |
