# 1A.4  Disciplinary and Suspension Procedure

 

### 1A.4.1    

Controllers not following The ATC Manual can expect the following procedure:

 

| Offense | Action Taken                          |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1st     | Warning via DM                        |
| 2nd     | 3 day Controller & Discord suspension |
| 3rd     | 7 day Controller & Discord suspension |
| 4th     | Removal from the IFATC Team           |

Following any suspension, Controllers will return at the rank they previously held. The date theyâ€™re reinstated on will serve as the new start date at that rank *(this is to take into account minimum requirements for rank upgrades - see [1A.3.1](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-new-entrants/1a.3-rank-structure#1a.3.1) above)*.



### 1A.4.2

If a Controller is issued a Level 2 or Level 3 Violation whilst operating as a pilot, the following can be expected (this will also count towards a Controllers total amount of offenses as outlined above):



| Violation | Action Taken                          |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Level 2   | 3 day Controller & Discord suspension |
| Level 3   | 7 day Controller & Discord suspension |



### 1A.4.3

Serious cases, reviewed by Moderators, are subject to immediate removal or suspension.
