# 7E.2 Appeals Process



### 7E.2.1

The following Violations **should not**{.red} be reversed:

- Level 1 Violations as these are system generated (unless evidence provided can show the root cause is technical - *see [7E.1.2](/guide/atc-manual/7e.-appeals/7e.1-overview#7e.1.2) above*)
- Violations occurring whilst the User is away from their device
- Violations that are related to network/device issues



### 7E.2.2

The following process outlines how appeals **must**{.red} be handled. If Appeals Team members feel that an exception is required, they may consult with Staff/IFC Moderators beforehand if you wish to do so:



Step 1

: A User will initiate a Level 2/3 Violation Appeal by making a public topic or by submitting a direct message addressed to the IFC *@appeals* group on the IFC



Step 2

: If not provided already, request that the User provides all pertinent information which can be done using a number of canned responses *(see [7E.2.4](/guide/atc-manual/7e.-appeals/7e.2-appeals-process#7e.2.4) below)*



Step 3

: The minimum required information to successfully review a Violation is Callsign and/or User Identifier, Date/Time Received, Controller Name, Replay/Screenshots (when applicable), and Scenario Details - **Violations more than 7 days old are not eligible for an appeal**{.red}



Step 4

: The Appeal is then reviewed using all available tools, perspectives, and media provided in the Appeal request. A determination to uphold or reverse the Violation is made and the User is notified of the Appeal resolution (justified Violations may be reversed sparingly when it has no impact on others or the User has a profile in good standing)



| Decision           | Action to be Taken                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Violation Upheld   | User is notified of a denied Appeal, provided with adequate reasoning, and to the maximum extent possible provided with resources (i.e. User Guide, Video Tutorial, Community Topics and/or an explanation of correct procedure) to prevent a similar Violation being issued in the future |
| Violation Reversed | User is notified of Violation reversal and instructed to relaunch the Infinite Flight app for the reversal to take effect. If ATC was at fault, the Appeals Team member **should**{.red} apologize for any inconvenience that may have been caused. If it was a courtesy reversal, the Appeals Team member **must**{.red} communicate that this is a "one-time" offering |



### 7E.2.3

The following procedure outlines how to reverse a Violation:



Step 1

: Access the Appeals Administrator Dashboard (link is provided in the *#appeals* Discord channel)



Step 2

: Select "Users" from the navigation bar and then enter the User information to search for their profile



Step 3

: To access the Users Profile, select the arrow under "Profile" that is in-line with their User information



Step 4

: Select "Violations" from the navigation bar and then scroll to find the Violation you would like to reverse



Step 5

: Tick the corresponding box and then scroll to the top of the page and select "Delete" to remove it. Any reversed Violation will prompt the Appeals Team member to input a reason (e.g. *"Violation Reversed: User performed go-around as instructed and was not given ample time to react"*). 



Tip

: If for any reason a User Note was not added, this can be done by selecting "Audit Logs" from the navigation bar and then "New User Note". User notes **should**{.red} be recorded to the max extent possible to monitor possible user trends, Appeal Team actions, and identify repeat offenders



### 7E.2.4

Below is a list of the different canned replies available that can be sent on the IFC. Appeals Team members **should**{.red} try to use these as often as possible to give Users a standardized experience, however at times it may be necessary to message outside of these:



| Canned Reply           | Recommended Usage                                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Correct Template Reply | If the original message includes all the information required to process the appeal *(see [7E.2.2](/guide/atc-manual/7e.-appeals/7e.2-appeals-process#7e.2.2) above)* |
| Replay Request         | TBC                                                          |
| Replay Request Short   | TBC                                                          |
| Sending Options Only   | TBC                                                          |
| Violation Removal      | If the violation has been removed                            |
