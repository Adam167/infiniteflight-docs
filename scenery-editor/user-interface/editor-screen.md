**Buildings**

| Button               | Function                                                     |

| Roof Orientation     | Tap the "+/-" symbols to adjust the orientation of the roof (you can also use the "Auto Roof Orientation" button) |
| Facade               | The facade style can be changed here but it will change all sides of the building, see [Editing Facades](/guide/scenery-editor/buildings-and-facades/editing-facades) for more information |
