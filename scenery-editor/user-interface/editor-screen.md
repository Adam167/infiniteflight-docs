# Editor Screen

Welcome to the editor screen within the Infinite Flight app. Below youâ€™ll find everything you need to know about the user interface!



![Scenery Editor Screen](_images/manual/frames/scenery-editor-screen.png)



1. The [management buttons](/guide/scenery-editor/user-interface/editor-screen#management-buttons) allow you to manage files, edit recent activity, change the view, adjust object altitude, change roof orientation, change building facades, and edit buildings

    

2. When a new editing session is started (even if you remain in-app), it will reset the "Last Saved" on the bottom bar to "N/A" (note: anything previously saved will still be there as the "last saved" information is only specific to the current editing session)

    

3. The main [navigation bar](/guide/scenery-editor/user-interface/editor-screen#navigation-bar) allows you to change between the library of objects, properties, loaded items, log and facades

     

4. The [edit buttons](/guide/scenery-editor/user-interface/editor-screen#edit-buttons) allow you to move, copy & paste, or deleted selected buildings and objects (you can also insert points if a building is selected)

     

5. The [camera](/guide/scenery-editor/user-interface/editor-screen#camera) in use can be changed here

   

6. The [settings](/guide/scenery-editor/user-interface/editor-screen#settings) page can be shown by tapping this button

## Camera



Tip

: Currently it is recommended to use the "Airport/Scen Editor" camera when editing however the "Free" camera is particularly useful for positioning the ATC Tower (for more info, see the ATC Tower tab under [Objects](/guide/scenery-editor/objects/objects))

Currently there are no new settings. Please look at the [Getting Started Guide](https://infiniteflight.com/guide/getting-started/home-user-interface/settings) for more information. 



## In-App Ruler

Step 1

: Place two fingers on your device's screen and hold



Step 2

: A rule will appear (both fingers must remain on the screen whilst using the ruler)

Step 4

: When you are finished with the ruler, simply remove your fingers from the screen
