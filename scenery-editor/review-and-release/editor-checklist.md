# Editor Checklist



Below is a checklist that editors should ensure is completed before marking an airport as complete and [ready for review](/guide/scenery-editor/review-and-release/review-process#review):



Tip

: If you would like to download this checklist to "tick" off as you go, it can be downloaded here (link coming soon)



## Airport Boundary & OSM

- [ ] OSM outside of airport boundary have been confirmed to be deleted
- [ ] Objects within boundary have their altitudes set
- [ ] Duplicate Buildings have been verified removed if Download OSM and Download OSM at Cursor were utilized



Tip

: Switch time and day to sunset or sunrise while conducting the secondary sweep of the airport boundary to ensure no green building outlines are visible



## Fire Stations

- [ ] Fire Stations have been added respective to their locations IRL
- [ ] Fire Station drive-thru and normal engine bay heights appear realistic (i.e. Bay doors shouldn’t appear to be 3 times the height of the large firefighting apparatus)
- [ ] Fire Station roof heights have been set
- [ ] Lighting has been provided to serve the exterior of the fire stations
- [ ] Firefighting trainer aircraft has been added to 3D airport if applicable



## Hangers

- [ ] Hangars are aligned with 2D Pavements
- [ ] Building layering is symmetrical and corners are accurately positioned at all intersections
- [ ] Roof Orientations have been auto coordinated
- [ ] Facades are coordinated as close to IRL as possible
- [ ] Adequate amount of points are provided especially for large buildings to ensure they render fully without glitching or disappearing
- [ ] Roof depths have been adjusted to match IRL imagery and/or mixed up to give ramps and remote areas more character



## Terminals

- [ ] Terminals are aligned with 2D Pavements
- [ ] Building layering is symmetrical and corners are accurately positioned at all intersections
- [ ] Roof Orientations have been auto coordinated
- [ ] Facades are coordinated as close to IRL as possible
- [ ] Adequate amount of points are provided especially for large buildings to ensure they render fully without glitching or disappearing
- [ ] Roof depths have been adjusted to match IRL imagery and/or mixed up to give ramps and remote areas more character



## Towers

- [ ] Tower(s) is(are) aligned with 2D Pavements (where applicable)
- [ ] Building layering is symmetrical and corners are accurately positioned at all intersections
- [ ] Roof Orientations have been auto coordinated
- [ ] Facades are coordinated as close to IRL as possible
- [ ] Adequate amount of points are provided especially for large buildings to ensure they render fully without glitching or disappearing
- [ ] ATC Towers have all been provided and the heights are set to IRL tower heights
- [ ] Roof depths have been adjusted to match IRL imagery and/or mixed up to give ramps and remote areas more character



## Beacons

- [ ] Beacons have been added and in positions found IRL



Tip

: Utilize time of day selected to night mode and place the beacon accordingly



## Fence

- [ ] Fences are joined properly and their orientations are consistent. I.e. posts and rails join smoothly, end posts marry up to buildings (where applicable) and are aligned with pavements (where applicable)
- [ ] Correct fence selection has been made. I.e. barb-wire vs no barb-wire
- [ ] Motorized gates have been added at roadway entrances and exits (where applicable)



## Hold Short Lighting

- [ ] Hold short lights have been provided at all runway intersections with Hold Lines
- [ ] Hold short lights are oriented respective to their IRL conditions either following straight taxi center lines or curved center lines so that they are visible to the PIC



## Jetbridges

- [ ] Jetbridge heights have been set to accommodate frequent aircraft and don’t conflict with wings, engines, and fuselage
- [ ] Jetbridge column heights have been set to meet the pavement without floating or sinking
- [ ] Jetbridge point is centered with the Base center point so that the 2 objects align precisely



## Localizers and Glide Slope Antennas

- [ ] Localizers are perpendicular to the runways (i.e. runway heading and LOC heading are the same)
- [ ] Slope Antennas are facing the approach cone and oriented with the runway heading



## Rooftop Equipment - AC units, Catwalks, Cooling Towers, Condensing Units, Ladders

- [ ] Rooftop equipment such as air conditioners, cooling towers, ladders, catwalks and penthouses have their heights auto-coordinated
- [ ] Equipment is aligned according IRL orientation and/or are aligned perpendicular/parallel to roof walls and penthouses



## Windsocks

- [ ] Wind socks have been added to each runway end
- [ ] Wind socks are provided as close to IRL imagery and airport chart data (if available)



## Vehicles - Belt Loaders, Cars, Catering Truck, Fuel Trucks, Tugs

- [ ] Objects aren’t overcrowding ramps, gates, parking lots and staging areas
- [ ] No objects are clipping one another (i.e. cargo pods, dollies, baggage carts, trucks, SUVs, fuel trucks, and catering vehicles)
- [ ] Cargo pods, loaders, cones and tugs are incorporated into cargo ramps
- [ ] GA Ramps have some substance such as cones, ladders, a few vehicles, light posts, ladders, and stairs
- [ ] Airport Fire & Rescue Trucks and Vans have been added to fire stations and substations
- [ ] Vehicles are clear and free from roadways
- [ ] Vehicles, cones, stairs, carts, and dollies are clear from obstructing Jetbridges, no wing strikes, no nose wheel or engine collisions



## VORs

- [ ] VORs have been added to the 3D airport if present IRL (utilizing available imagery and airport charts)
- [ ] VOR sizing correctly portrays what is at the airport IRL. I.e. VOR (small) or VOR has been placed within the airport boundary
