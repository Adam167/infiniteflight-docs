| Orientation          | Tap the "+/-" symbols to adjust the orientation of the object |
| 3D Model Name        | N/A                                                          |
| Animations           | N/A                                                          |
| 3D Model Ref Name    | N/A                                                          |
| Latitude / Longitude | Current latitude/longitude of the building                   |

| Name                 | You can name the object using this field                     |
| Frozen               | Tap the "tick" symbols to toggle between the building being frozen (orange tick) and unfrozen (grey tick). Frozen buildings cannot be edited until they have been unfrozen, this can be useful to avoid changing buildings by accident whilst editing other things nearby |
