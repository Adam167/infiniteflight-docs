| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

| Orientation          | Tap the "+/-" symbols to adjust the orientation of the object |
| 3D Model Name        | N/A                                                          |
| Animations           | N/A                                                          |
| 3D Model Ref Name    | N/A                                                          |
