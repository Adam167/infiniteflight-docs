# Properties



Step 1

: Select the building by tapping on or near the blue circle that is in the center of the object. You can also tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to select multiple buildings (a white box will appear to show the catchment area)



Step 2

: Tap the "Properties" tab on the right side of the screen



Step 3

: You can then adjust the following properties:



| Button               | Function                                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Height               | This shows the height (in meters) of the building. Tap the number and then enter in a new value to adjust this |
| Roof Orientation     | Tap the "+/-" symbols to adjust the orientation of the roof (you can also use the "Auto Roof Orientation" button) |
| Facade               | The facade style can be changed here but it will change all sides of the building, see [Editing Facades](/guide/scenery-editor/buildings-and-facades/editing-facades) for more information |
| Roof Depth           | This shows the roof depth (in meters) of the building. Tap the number and then enter in a new value between 0 and 1 to adjust this |
| Latitude / Longitude | Current latitude/longitude of the building                   |
| Altitude             | This shows the current altitude (in meters) of the building. Tap the number and then enter in a new value to adjust this |
| Name                 | You can name the building using this field                   |
| Frozen               | Tap the "tick" symbols to toggle between the building being frozen (orange tick) and unfrozen (grey tick). Frozen buildings cannot be edited until they have been unfrozen, this can be useful to avoid changing buildings by accident whilst editing other things nearby |
| Type                 | N/A                                                          |
