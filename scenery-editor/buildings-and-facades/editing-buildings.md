# Editing Buildings



Step 1

: Select the building by tapping on or near the blue circle that is in the center of the object. You can also tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to select multiple buildings (a white box will appear to show the catchment area)



Step 2

: The circle will turn magenta to indicate it has been selected



Step 3

: Tap the "Building" button on the left side of the screen, and then "Edit Building"



Tip

: Ensure that you have the "Move" button on the right side of the screen is selected (highlighted in orange)



Step 4

: The nodes for each corner will appear, by tapping a node it will turn magenta to show it has been selected. You can also tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to select multiple nodes (a white box will appear to show the catchment area)



Step 5

: You can then tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to move the node(s) into the desired position



Tip

: If when moving around the airport you notice rendering issues with the buildings (i.e. a "judder" motion), the building is duplicated and one will need to be selected and deleted to fix this
