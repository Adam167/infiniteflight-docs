# Editing Buildings



Step 1

: Select the building by tapping on or near the blue circle that is in the center of the object **(1)**. You can also tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen **(2)** to select multiple buildings (a white box will appear to show the catchment area)



![Selecting Buildings](_images/manual/frames/selecting-buildings.png)



Step 2

: The circle will turn magenta **(3)** to indicate it has been selected



Step 3

: Tap the "Building" button **(4)** on the left side of the screen, and then "Edit Building" **(5)**

Tip

: Ensure that the "Move" button **(6)** on the right side of the screen is selected (highlighted in orange)



Step 4

: The nodes for each corner will appear, by tapping a node it will turn magenta to show it has been selected. You can also tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to select multiple nodes (a white box will appear to show the catchment area)



Step 5

: You can then tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to move the node(s) into the desired position



Tip

: If when moving around the airport you notice rendering issues with the buildings (i.e. a "judder" motion), the building is duplicated and one will need to be selected and deleted to fix this



Step 6

: When editing is complete, tap "Edit Building" **(5)** to deselect it (you will be unable to edit other buildings without doing this) 



## Layering

The below steps highlight a good method for adding detail to buildings (layering) however you may find different methods that you prefer:



Step 1

: [OSM](/guide/scenery-editor/user-interface/editor-screen#management-buttons) will automatically place the buildings when downloaded however you may find that they do not completely align with pavements. You can [move the buildings](/guide/scenery-editor/buildings-and-facades/editing-buildings) to make them more "flush" with the pavement edging



Tip

: We recommend [changing the whole building facade](/guide/scenery-editor/buildings-and-facades/editing-facades) to something plain (e.g. terminal 1, face 1) before starting to layer as this will make it easier for depth perception 



Step 2

: Change the [building height](/guide/scenery-editor/buildings-and-facades/properties). If it is a hanger you can use the [minimum hangar heights](/guide/scenery-editor/getting-started/aircraft-categories#minimum-hangar-heights-for-aircraft) for guidance. For terminals or other complicated buildings, it is better to create multiple levels. Any level that is not the top floor should have the [roof depth](/guide/scenery-editor/buildings-and-facades/properties) set to zero



Tip

: For terminals that have jetbridges, the first layer should be given a height of approximately 4.5 meters (varies dependant on what type of jetbridge being used). When jetbridges are then attached, the floor will align with the second layer



Step 3

: If making multiple floors, first [copy & paste](/guide/scenery-editor/buildings-and-facades/selection-and-placement#copy-%26-pasting-a-building) the first layer of the building



Tip

: Before tapping paste, tap somewhere else on the map to avoid in-app crashes



Step 4

: [Drag the newly copied building](/guide/scenery-editor/buildings-and-facades/selection-and-placement#changing-orientation-of-a-building) so that the magenta dot is somewhere over the first layer (original building)



Step 5

: [Using the management buttons](/guide/scenery-editor/user-interface/editor-screen#management-buttons) on the left of the screen, tap "Object" and then "Auto Altitude". This will raise the newly copied building to make it the second layer (roof height of the first layer). You can also set the [height](/guide/scenery-editor/buildings-and-facades/properties) of the building manually if needed for the same effect



Step 6

: Using external sources, [continue to adjust the size and shapes](/guide/scenery-editor/buildings-and-facades/editing-buildings) of the layers to replicate the overall look of the building. For passenger terminals a minimum of three layers is recommended



Tip

: Don't forget that you can also make layers that are a tiny height, this will give you the option of changing the roof colour for example without the different facade being visible to keep the building look the same



Step 7

: With every new layer added, don't forget to [name it appropriately](/guide/scenery-editor/buildings-and-facades/properties) (tap on the building > select properties > tap name to edit)
