# Editing Buildings



Step 1

: Select the building by tapping on or near the blue circle that is in the center of the object **(1)**. You can also tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen **(2)** to select multiple buildings (a white box will appear to show the catchment area)

Step 2

: The circle will turn magenta **(3)** to indicate it has been selected



Step 3

: Tap the "Building" button **(4)** on the left side of the screen, and then "Edit Building" **(5)**

Tip

: Ensure that the "Move" button **(6)** on the right side of the screen is selected (highlighted in orange)



Step 4

: The nodes for each corner will appear, by tapping a node it will turn magenta to show it has been selected. You can also tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to select multiple nodes (a white box will appear to show the catchment area)



Step 5

: You can then tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to move the node(s) into the desired position



Tip

: If when moving around the airport you notice rendering issues with the buildings (i.e. a "judder" motion), the building is duplicated and one will need to be selected and deleted to fix this



## Layering

The below steps highlight a good method for adding detail to buildings (layering) however you may find different methods that you prefer:



Step 1

: Conform the building to the path of where you are putting it. OSM will place the building wherever it is, but move the buildings to match more flush with the pavement, maybe adjust the perimeter to match the pavement 



Tip

: Change the facade to a bland default to make it look easier for depth perception (e.g termin 1 face 1, it is plain which helps when layering)



Step 2

: Changing the overall building height, if it was a terminal that will have jetbridges, make it a height of usually be 4.5 meters (may need to be changed slightly based on different jetbridges used) for the first layer. When you then attach jetbridges, the next layer will mean facades will match with the next layer. Also change the roof depth to zero on the first layer to flat



Step 3

: Layer 2 is now ready, tap on building, copy the building, and then paste 



Tip

: Tap somewhere else on the ramp before tapping paste to avoid an app crash



Step 4

: Drag the newly copied building  so that the magenta dot is somewhere over level 1 (original building)



Step 5

: Open up object tab and click auto altitude, this will raise the newly copied building to make it level 2 (roof height of level 1)



Step 6

: Then continue to adjust size and shapes to match your external sources



Tip

: Recommend a minimum of three layers for pax terminals, for hangers, even if the third layer is tiny. You can even make a tiny height and change the facade to get a different roof color and this will show even without the sides showing
