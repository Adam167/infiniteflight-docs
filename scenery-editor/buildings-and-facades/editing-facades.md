# Editing Facades



Step 1

: Select the building by tapping on or near the blue circle that is in the center of the building



Step 2

: The circle will turn magenta to indicate it has been selected



Step 3

: Tap the "Building" button on the left side of the screen, and then "Set Texture & Facades"



Step 4

: Tap the bottom left hand button to select a different style 



Step 5

: The building will automatically change all faces to match the style selected and will be surrounded by green lines that join each node. To change individual sides, tap one of these green lines (it will turn magenta to show it is selected). You can also tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to select multiple lines (a white box will appear to show the catchment area)



Step 6

: Scroll up/down the list on the left of the screen to see the different faces available for that style



Step 7

: Select the desired face and then tap "Assign" (it will not let you assign a face without one or more sides of a building selected)



Tip

: Currently you cannot use different styles on the same building, only different faces of one style. Therefore to be able to use different styles, you may need to make a whole building up using multiple, smaller buildings!



You can also change the facade style on multiple buildings at the same time, to do this:



Step 1

: Tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to select multiple buildings (a white box will appear to show the catchment area)



Step 2

: The circles in the center of the buildings will turn magenta to indicate they have been selected



Step 3

: Tap "Properties"



Step 4

: Tap the facade style next to "Facade" and select an option from the drop-down list, you can scroll up/down the list to see the different styles available



Tip

: This method will set give the selected buildings the same facade style, however to change individual faces, the first method shown will need to be used
