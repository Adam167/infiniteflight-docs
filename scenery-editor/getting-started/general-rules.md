# General Rules



The following rules must be observed at all times when editing airports:



- Always delete OSM buildings not in the airport boundary
- Do not add vehicles or objects to road surfaces
- Keep objects and facades as realistic as possible
- Do not add objects to fill empty spaces if there are no objects shown on maps
- Only edit the airports allocated to you
- Customs towers are only permitted when a tower cab - i.e. when the tower cab is placed in/on a poly building (poly buildings must not be used to make "support" legs)



Tip

: Make sure you save your airport regularly and share to yourself via email as a backup!
