# General Rules



The following rules must be observed at all times when editing airports:



- Delete OSM buildings not in the airport boundary
- Do not add vehicles or objects to road surfaces
- Keep objects and facades as realistic as possible
- Do not add objects to fill empty spaces if there are no objects shown on maps
- Only edit the airports allocated to you in the welcome post
- No custom ATC Towers are permitted (the only exception to this is when the tower cab is placed in/on a poly building however poly buildings must not be used to make "support" legs)



Tip

: Make sure you save your airport regularly and share to yourself via email as a backup!
