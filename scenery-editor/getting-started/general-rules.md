# General Rules



The following rules must be observed at all times when editing airports:



- Delete OSM buildings not in the airport boundary
- Do not add vehicles or objects to road surfaces
- Keep objects and facades as realistic as possible
- Do not add objects to fill empty spaces if there are no objects shown on maps
- Only edit the airports allocated to you in the welcome post
- No custom ATC Towers are permitted (the only exception to this is when the tower cab is placed in/on a poly building however poly buildings must not be used to make "support" legs)



Tip

: Please be aware that this is a pre-alpha build, and there are many things that are V1 and still in early development. This means that the app is likely to crash. Make sure you save your airport regularly and share to yourself via email as a backup. If an airport is lost, we cannot recover it at this time. There is no autosave function
