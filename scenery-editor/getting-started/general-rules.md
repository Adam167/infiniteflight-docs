# General Rules



The following rules must be observed at all times when editing airports:



- Always delete OSM buildings not in the airport boundary
- Do not add vehicles or objects to road surfaces
- Keep objects and facades as realistic as possible
- Do not add objects to fill empty spaces if there are no objects shown on maps
- Only edit the airports allocated to you
- Adding customs towers should be avoided where possible however if you feel that it is required for the overall look of the airport, a request must be made beforehand for authorization
- Only one airport can be edited at a time, and other airports cannot be reserved for future work (whilst another airport is being edited)



Tip

: Make sure you save your airport regularly and share to yourself via email as a backup!
