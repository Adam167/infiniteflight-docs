# First Steps



Step 1

: Open the Infinite Flight App and select "Scenery Editor"



Step 2

: Choose the airport you have been assigned and then select any runway or parking position. Hit "Ok" to begin



Step 3

: Download the Open Street Map (OSM) data by tapping "File" **(1)** and then "Download OSM" **(2)**

Tip

: If you have previously downloaded the OSM but subsequently delete some buildings in error (and these changes are saved), it may be more appropriate to use "Download OSM at Cursor". This option will only download the data within 200m of the cursor on the map, and may help avoid duplicate buildings being downloaded (which could result from using the "Download OSM" button instead)



Step 4

: Delete all buildings outside of the airport boundary by tapping on or near the blue circle that is in the center of the building **(1)** and then tapping "Delete Selection" **(2)** on the right side of the screen. You can also tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to select multiple buildings (a white box will appear to show the catchment area)

Step 5

: You can then move onto editing the airport and it is your choice what you start with



Tip

: Remember to regularly save and upload your work. You can do this by tapping "File" and then "Save", or "File", "File Manager" and then "Upload" respectively
