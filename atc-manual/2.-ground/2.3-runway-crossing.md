# 2.3  Runway Crossing

 

### 2.3.1    

For runway crossings, the runway **must**{.red} be referred to in the direction it is being used, regardless of the aircraft position or what the pilot requests *(see [2.3.4](/guide/atc-manual/2.-ground/2.3-runway-crossing#2.3.4) below for exceptions)*. For example, if a pilot is by the threshold of RWY36, but the other end is being used for departures and arrivals, the pilot **must**{.red} be instructed to cross RWY18, not RWY36.



### 2.3.2    

The crossing **must**{.red} only be issued when the appropriate spacing exists to allow for the traffic to cross and clear the runway edge (not hold short line) prior to the arriving traffic crossing the runway threshold or the departing traffic commencing the take-off roll (coordination with the Tower Controller is required to ensure another aircraft is not cleared for take-off whilst an aircraft is crossing the runway).



### 2.3.3    

Anticipated runway crossings are encouraged and **should**{.red} be used rather than waiting for the pilot to request it. If you see the runway crossing is required, issue it in advance if traffic permits.



### 2.3.4

If the taxiways are not directly aligned with each other, then a back-taxi instruction **must**{.red} be used instead of a runway crossing command as the pilot will have to taxi on the runway before exiting. In this case, the runway must be referred to in the direction that the Controller wants the aircraft to back-taxi in (however progressive taxi commands may be used in addition to this to ensure the aircraft exits at the appropriate taxiway).
