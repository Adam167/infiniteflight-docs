# 4.3  Runway Crossing

 

### 4.3.1    

For runway crossings, the runway **must** be referred to in the direction it is being used, regardless of the aircraft position or what the pilot requests. For example, if a pilot is by the threshold of RWY36, but the other end is being used for departures and arrivals, the pilot **must** be instructed to cross RWY18, not RWY36.



### 4.3.2    

The crossing **must** only be issued when the approach path is clear and you have coordinated with the Tower Controller to ensure another aircraft is not cleared for take-off.



### 4.3.3    

Anticipated runway crossings are encouraged and **should** be used rather than waiting for the pilot to request it. If you see the runway crossing is required, issue it in advance if traffic permits.
