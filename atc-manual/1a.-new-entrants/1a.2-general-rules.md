# 1A.2  General Rules

 

Tip

: All Controllers **must**{.red} ensure that their IFC Username, Slack Display Name, and IF Display Name have a measure of consistency so that they can easily be found if required *(see [1A.2.1](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-new-entrants/1a.2-general-rules#1a.2.1) below)*



### 1A.2.1    

The following rules **must**{.red} be followed at all times:

 

|                          **Slack**                           |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| Your Slack username **must**{.red} remain consistent. Please use your first name, if able. |
| Controllers **must not**{.red} share any IFATC material or conversations contained within the IFATC Slack externally (unless prior approval has been granted). |
| Be respectful to other users and refrain from profanity & offensive dialogue (including, but not limited to; racist and sexual comments). |
| Criticism and feedback will generally be given via DM; however, on occasion, it may be provided publicly if it is  deemed to be a wider issue amongst Controllers. |
| Off topic material, including memes and GIFs, **must not**{.red} be used outside of the #discussions channel. |



|                       **Controlling**                        |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| All Controllers **must**{.red} announce in #controllers when opening/closing any frequency on the Expert Server. When closing, a **MINIMUM**{.red} of 5 minutes warning and the last ATIS letter used **must**{.red} be provided. |
| Controllers **must**{.red} control within the bounds of the ATC Schedule posted every week on the IFC  and in #readonly on Slack. The only exception to this is when Controllers are not qualified to do so as per the rank structure *(see [1A.3.1](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-new-entrants/1a.3-rank-structure#1a.3.1) below)*, in which case a sensible alternative can be selected. |
| Opening frequencies is on a first come, first serve basis within #controllers. Therefore Controllers **should not**{.red} reserve frequencies privately or not open in anticipation of a particular frequency becoming  available. This does not apply to certain events where frequency allocation may be authorized. |
| Controllers **must not**{.red} control on the Training Server *(see [7.5.4](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.5-radar-theory-and-practical-tests#7.5.4) below for exceptions).* |
| Controllers **must not**{.red} act as a Controller and as a pilot simultaneously on separate devices, violating Infinite Flight’s Terms & Agreement. |
| Standards of controlling are closely monitored – **Controllers are expected to control within their means,  prioritizing quality over quantity**{.red} *(see [1A.3](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-new-entrants/1a.3-rank-structure#1a.3-rank-structure) below)* |
