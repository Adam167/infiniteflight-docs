# 1A.1  Slack Communication Guidelines

 

### 1A.1.1    

Slack is a messenger app for teams to make work simpler, more pleasant and more productive. More information on how this app works can be found at https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us.



### 1A.1.2    

Group chats are authorized as long as they do not diminish effectiveness of primary channels. Controllers are encouraged to utilize group messages or threads for specific interest groups amongst Controllers. Slack rules will still be enforced if an issue is brought to the attention of a Supervisor or above.

 

### 1A.1.3   

 The channels and their use is outlined in the table below:

 

| **Channel**    | **Purpose**                                                  |
| -------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| #controllers   | All normal Controller communications to occur in this channel. This channel **should not**{.red} be used unless **ACTIVELY**{.red} controlling. |
| #discussions   | A space for mature dialogue about Infinite  Flight and aviation related topics for active Controllers. Moderate off topic conversation is acceptable but **should**{.red} be kept to a minimum. |
| #readonly      | News, updates and important team announcements to be made on this channel by the ATC Community Manager and Moderators only. Controllers **must not**{.red} reply to  any material posted in this channel so that all Controllers can be reached effectively. |
| #flights       | This channel will be used for Controllers to coordinate group flights together. All coordination **should**{.red} remain in this channel. |
| #issues        | Any issues that occur that specifically involve controlling **should**{.red} be placed in this channel with the following information included:  -      Specific issue  -      UTC time issue occurred  -      Pilot username / callsign involved  -      Controller username  -      ATC facility |
| #training-time | Trainers will post in this channel when they require pilots to join in for training  sessions, the relevant instructions are pinned within the channel. |



### 1A.1.4 

Slash commands allow a user to type a keyword using the following format: ‘/<command>’

 

### 1A.1.5   

Below are some of the commands that can be used:

 

**/atc** – shows all open frequencies

**/away** – sets your Slack status to “away”

**/deletion** – shows you how to delete your files, this **must**{.red} be done **REGULARLY**{.red}

**/descent [altitude to lose] [groundspeed]** – provides descent guidance when flying

**/gmt** – provides the current (local) time in GMT

**/livestatus** – provides a link to the IFATC facility status page

**/metar [KSSC]** – shows the current, live METAR information for a selected airport

**/mystats** – search for your IFATC statistics

**/open [channel]** – opens the specified channel

**/reference** – provides a link to the folder that contains this document

**/remind** – allows you to set helpful reminders

**/training** – provides a link to the current training schedule 



Tip

: ALL Controllers **must**{.red} run the /deletion Slack slash command regularly to delete files, this helps to prevent the IFATC Slack storage from becoming full
