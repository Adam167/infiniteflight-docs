# 1A.1  Discord Communication Guidelines

 

### 1A.1.1    

Discord is a messenger app for teams to make work simpler, more pleasant and more productive. More information on how this app works can be found [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us).



### 1A.1.2    

Group chats are authorized as long as they do not diminish effectiveness of primary channels. Controllers are encouraged to utilize group messages for specific interest groups amongst Controllers. Discord rules will be enforced if an issue is brought to the attention of a Supervisor or above.

 

### 1A.1.3   

 The channels and their use is outlined in the table below:

 

| **Channel**            | **Purpose**                                                  |
| ---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| #announcements         | Official Infinite Flight updates (such as new blog update, new version of the ATC Manual, Beta information etc) to be made in this channel by the ATC Manager, Staff and Moderators only.

| #offtopic              | This is a channel to discuss things unrelated to IFATC or Infinite Flight. All conversations **should**{.red} remain appropriate. #offtopic is a privilege and all members are subject to removal at any time if misused. This is for active members only. |
| #readonly              | Day to day posts (such as housekeeping, schedule releases, FNF specific procedures etc) to be made in this channel by the ATC Manager, Staff and Moderators only. Controllers **must not**{.red} reply to any material posted in this channel so that all Controllers can be reached effectively. |
| #role-assignments      | Within this channel is a 'notification opt in' menu - Controllers can react with the corresponding emoji to opt in and when that particular word/tag is used, the Controller will receive a notification. |
