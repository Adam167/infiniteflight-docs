# 1A.1  Discord Communication Guidelines

 

### 1A.1.1    

Discord is a messenger app for teams to make work simpler, more pleasant and more productive. More information on how this app works can be found [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us).



### 1A.1.2    

Group chats are authorized as long as they do not diminish effectiveness of primary channels. Controllers are encouraged to utilize group messages for specific interest groups amongst Controllers. Discord rules will be enforced if an issue is brought to the attention of a Supervisor or above.

 

### 1A.1.3   

 The channels and their use is outlined in the table below:

 

| **Channel**            | **Purpose**                                                  |
| ---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| #announcements         | Official Infinite Flight updates (such as new blog update, new version of the ATC Manual, Beta information etc) to be made in this channel by the ATC Manager, Staff and Moderators only. Controllers **must not**{.red} reply to any material posted in this channel so that all Controllers can be reached effectively. |
| #botcommands           | All bot commands **should**{.red} only be used in this channel. *!command* can be typed in this channel to bring up a list of available commands for use *(see [1A.1.5](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-new-entrants/1a.1-discord-communication-guidelines#1a.1.5) below)* |

| #infinite-flight-rules | Highlights where to find the rules of the IFATC Discord server. |
| #offtopic              | This is a channel to discuss things unrelated to IFATC or Infinite Flight. All conversations **should**{.red} remain appropriate. *#offtopic* is a privilege and all members are subject to removal at any time if misused. This is for active members only. |
| #readonly              | Day to day posts (such as housekeeping, schedule releases, FNF specific procedures etc) to be made in this channel by the ATC Manager, Staff and Moderators only.

**!command** - provides a list of all available commands that can be used

**%chart[icao]** - gives you the latest charts of the chosen airport

**/checkride** - shows Supervisors who is currently in the Check Ride phase

### 1A.1.6

The use of Voice Channels (VC's) **must**{.red} only be used in accordance with the Discord and Discord Voice Channel rules *(see [1A.2.1](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-new-entrants/1a.2-general-rules#1a.2.1) below)*. Controllers who are operating an airport independently without assistance **should not**{.red} claim a VC unless:

- the control positions are split (e.g. passing Ground control to another member whilst still operating Tower)
- a Radar Controller opens at the airport
- and/or all facility Controllers opt to communicate via a VC in *#controllers*



The use of VC's is **not required**{.red} and is at the sole discretion of the IFATC member (there may be select events where the use of VC's is required to guarantee operational efficiency - if this is the case, Controllers that do not wish to use voice may have to control elsewhere).

Controllers who wish to observe others in a VC for educational purposes may **ONLY**{.red} do so if **ALL**{.red} operational Controllers in the VC have given consent. Observers **must not**{.red} distract from the active ATC operation and **should**{.red} remain muted.



Below are some useful tips for VC's:

- You can see how many members currently occupy a VC at any time by noting the [00/08] channel count!
- Selecting "Mute" means no one can hear you
- Selecting "Deafen" means you don't hear anyone else
- Always double check your sound settings (i.e. Input = Mic and Output = Speaker)
- Connecting to a VC will act much like a phone call and can run in the background while controlling
