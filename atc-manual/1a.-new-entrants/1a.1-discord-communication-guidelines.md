# 1A.1  Discord Communication Guidelines

 

### 1A.1.1    

Discord is a messenger app for teams to make work simpler, more pleasant and more productive. More information on how this app works can be found [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us).



### 1A.1.2    

Group chats are authorized as long as they do not diminish effectiveness of primary channels. Controllers are encouraged to utilize group messages for specific interest groups amongst Controllers. Discord rules will be enforced if an issue is brought to the attention of a Supervisor or above.

 

### 1A.1.3   

 The channels and their use is outlined in the table below:

 

| **Channel**            | **Purpose**                                                  |
| ---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| #announcements         | Official Infinite Flight updates (such as new blog update, new version of the ATC Manual, Beta information etc) to be made in this channel by the ATC Manager, Staff and Moderators only. Controllers **must not**{.red} reply to any material posted in this channel so that all Controllers can be reached effectively. |
| #controllers           | All normal Controller communications to occur in this channel. This channel **should not**{.red} be used unless **ACTIVELY**{.red} controlling. |
| #controlling[1-5]      |                                                              |
| #discussions           | This is a channel for active controllers to engage in discussion regarding IFATC, ATC, Infinite Flight, and Aviation. All off-topic conversation **should**{.red} be kept to PM. |
| #flights               | This channel will be used for Controllers to coordinate group flights together. All coordination **should**{.red} remain in this channel. |
| #ifatceg               | This channel contains news, tips and more brought to you by the IFATC Education Group |
| #infinite-flight-rules | Highlights where to find the rules of the IFATC Discord server. |
| #offtopic              | This is a channel to discuss things unrelated to IFATC or Infinite Flight. All conversations **should**{.red} remain appropriate. *#offtopic* is a privilege and all members are subject to removal at any time if misused. This is for active members only. |
| #readonly              | Day to day posts (such as housekeeping, schedule releases, FNF specific procedures etc) to be made in this channel by the ATC Manager, Staff and Moderators only. Controllers **must not**{.red} reply to any material posted in this channel so that all Controllers can be reached effectively. |
| #role-assignments      | Within this channel is a 'notification opt in' menu - Controllers can react with the corresponding emoji to opt in and when the mentioned phrase is used, the Controller will receive a notification. |
| #training-time         | Trainers will post in this channel when they require pilots to join in for training sessions, including which training-time channel the session will take place in. |
| #training-time[1-3]    | All training session coordination to take place in the designated channel as directed by the Trainer (no more than one training session per channel **must**{.red} be used at any one time). |



### 1A.1.4 

Slash commands allow a user to type a keyword using the following format: ‘/<command>’

 

### 1A.1.5   

Below are some of the commands that can be used:

 

**/approve** - shows recruits that need their application approved (for use by Moderators ONLY)

**/atc** – shows all open frequencies

**/atis[icao]** – shows current ATIS message for that particular airport

**/checkride** - shows Supervisors who is currently in the Check Ride phase

**/gmt** – provides the current (local) time in GMT

**/find [search phrase]** – this can be used to find a member of IFATC within Discord

**/mystats** – search for your IFATC statistics

**/reference** – provides a link to the IFATC Google Drive

**/schedule** - shows a list of scheduled training/testing sessions in the next 48 hours



### 1A.1.6

The use of Voice Channels **must**{.red} only be used in accordance with the Discord and Discord Voice Channel rules *(see [1A.2.1](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-new-entrants/1a.2-general-rules#1a.2.1) below)*. Controllers who are operating an airport independently without assistance **should not**{.red} claim a Voice Channel unless:

- the control positions are split (e.g. passing Ground control to another member whilst still operating Tower)
- a Radar Controller opens at the airport
- and/or all facility Controllers opt to communicate via a Voice Channel in *#controllers*



The use of Voice Channels is **not required**{.red} and is at the sole discretion of the IFATC member (there may be select events where the use of Voice Channels is required to guarantee operational efficiency - if this is the case, Controllers that do not wish to use voice may have to control elsewhere).

Controllers who wish to observe others in a Voice Channel for educational purposes may **ONLY**{.red} do so if **ALL**{.red} operational Controllers in the Voice Channel have given consent. Observers **must not**{.red} distract from the active ATC operation and **should**{.red} remain muted.



Below are some useful tips for Voice Channels:

- You can see how many members currently occupy a Voice Channel at any time by noting the [00/08] channel count!
- Selecting "Mute" means no one can hear you
- Selecting "Deafen" means you don't hear anyone else
- Always double check your sound settings (i.e. Input = Mic and Output = Speaker)
- Connecting to a Voice Channel will act much like a phone call and can run in the background while controlling
