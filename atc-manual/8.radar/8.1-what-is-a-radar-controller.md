# 8.1  What is a Radar Controller?

 

Tip

: It is encouraged that new radar controllers start off slowly, gradually building up to the more ‘high-volume’ traffic airports. This is particularly important during peak times or events such as Friday Night Flight (FNF)

 

### 8.1.1   

Although the radar position and its responsibilities are vast, fundamentally, there are three main objectives. These are:

 

\-    Providing aircraft & terrain separation

\-    Reducing tower controller workload

\-    Providing an expeditious departure, en-route and/or arrival service
