# 8.4  Departure, SIDs and the Use of Check In

 

### 8.4.1    

Departure control typically includes managing:

 

\-    VFR aircraft, with or without a flight plan

\-    and IFR aircraft (which **should** have a flight plan)

 

### 8.4.2    

If straight-out departures are in use, the departure and tower controllers **should** coordinate to ensure a seamless service *(see 5.5.1 above)*.



### 8.4.3    

Standard Instrument Departures, known as SIDs, are a published flight procedure that are followed by aircraft on an IFR flight plan immediately after departure and are available in select regions of Infinite Flight. SIDs allow aircraft to depart an airspace following a pre-defined route (and in some cases with altitude restrictions) that help them navigate adjacent airspaces, terrain and arriving traffic. Controllers **should** let aircraft continue on a SID to the maximum extent possible after departure unless vectors are required for sequencing or traffic avoidance.



### 8.4.4    

Controllers can expect aircraft to ‘Check In’ after departure if they want to follow their flight plan (including the SID). Controllers **must** respond with ‘Radar Contact’ and then the same rules as per Flight Following apply; aircraft can however, still be vectored or issued altitude assignments if required *(see 8.5.2 below).* Controllers **must** issue ‘Continue as Filed’ when vectors are no longer required.
