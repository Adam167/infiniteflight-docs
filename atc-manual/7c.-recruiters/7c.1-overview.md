# 7C.1 Overview



### 7C.1.1

The Recruitment Team (Recruiters) have two main responsibilities, these are to manage new entrants during the recruitment process to join IFATC and secondly, to administer all theory and practical tests, with the final say on the result of the test (i.e. pass/fail).



### 7C.1.2

Recruiters are selected by the IFATC Manager based on a number of criteria, including, but not limited to:



- ATC theoretical knowledge & practical application


- time zone availability
- standing within IFATC
- and/or contributions to the IFATC team as a whole



### 7C.1.3 

The following table outlines the minimum notice period that **must**{.red} be given to a Candidate/Controller before their Initial or Radar Practical Test (including the test location):



| Test Type | Minimum Notice Period |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| Initial   | No minimum            |
| Radar     | 24 hours*             |

**The notice period may be reduced if the Recruiter and Candidate/Controller find a mutually acceptable time*



### 7C.1.4

To ensure test transparency (and provided resources allow), Recruiters **should not**{.red} administer The Initial or Radar Practical Test(s) for any Candidates/Controllers that they have personally trained.



### 7C.1.5

When new Recruiters are selected, they will be added to the following channels within Discord:



| Channel        | Purpose                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| #recruiters    | Main channel for coordination purposes within the Recruitment Team |
| #tests         | Recruiters will post in this channel when they require pilots to join in for a Practical Test (Initial or Radar). Testers available for the test can "react" to the post to indicate attendance. If all available slots are already filled, Testers **must not**{.red} "react" to the request |
| #tester [VC]   | This can be used for test participants as a general lounge or operationally to coordinate during an active test. All feedback **should**{.red} still given in writing via the test topic |
| #trainers      | Main channel for coordination purposes within the Training Team |
| #training      | Trainers will use this channel to create a topic for each scheduled training session. This is where training session objectives, assignments, and feedback will be given |
| #training-time | Trainers will post in this channel when they require pilots to join in for a training session. Pilots available for the session can "react" to the post to indicate attendance. If all available slots are already filled, Pilots **must not**{.red} "react" to the request |
