# 7C.1 Overview



### 7C.1.1

The Recruitment Team (Recruiters) have two main responsibilities, these are to manage new entrants during the recruitment process to join IFATC and secondly, to administer all theory and practical tests, with the final say on the result of the test (i.e. pass/fail).



### 7C.1.2

Recruiters are selected by the IFATC Manager based on a number of criteria, including, but not limited to:



- ATC theoretical knowledge & practical application


- time zone availability
- standing within IFATC
- and/or contributions to the IFATC team as a whole



### 7C.1.3 

The following table outlines the minimum notice period that **must**{.red} be given to a Candidate/Controller before their Initial or Radar Practical Test (including the test location):



| Test Type | Minimum Notice Period |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| Initial   | No minimum            |
| Radar     | 24 hours*             |

*The notice period may be reduced if the Recruiter and Candidate/Controller find a mutually acceptable time.



### 7C.1.4

When new Recruiters are selected, they will be added to the following channels within Discord:



| Channel             | Purpose                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| #recruiters         | Main channel for coordination purposes within the Recruitment Team. |
| #trainers           | Main channel for coordination purposes within the Training Team. |
| #training-time[1-3] | Trainers will post in the *#training-time* channel when they require pilots to join in for training sessions, including which training-time channel the session will take place in (no more than one training session per channel **must**{.red} be used at any one time). |
| #testers[1-3]       | These channels are used to conduct Practical Tests (both Initial and Radar). Recruiters will post in channel 1, 2 or 3 when they require pilots to join in for test sessions. If a channel is already occupied, another channel **must**{.red} be used instead. |
