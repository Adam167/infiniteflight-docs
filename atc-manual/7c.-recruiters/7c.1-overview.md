# 7C.1 Overview



### 7C.1.1

The Recruitment Team (Recruiters) have two main responsibilities, these are to manage new entrants during the recruitment process to join IFATC and secondly, to administer all theory and practical tests, with the final say on the result of the test (i.e. pass/fail).



### 7C.1.2

Recruiters are selected by the IFATC Manager based on a number of criteria, including, but not limited to:



- ATC theoretical knowledge & practical application


- time zone availability
- standing within IFATC
- and/or contributions to the IFATC team as a whole



### 7C.1.3 

The following table outlines the minimum notice period that **must**{.red} be given to a Recruit before their Tower or Radar Practical Test (including the test location):



| Test Type | Minimum Notice Period |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| Tower     | No minimum            |
| Radar     | 24 hours*             |

**The notice period may be reduced if the Recruiter and Recruit find a mutually acceptable time*



### 7C.1.4

To ensure test transparency (and provided resources allow), Recruiters **should not**{.red} administer the Tower or Radar Practical Test(s) for any Recruit that they have personally trained.



### 7C.1.5

When new Recruiters are selected, they will be added to the following channels within Discord:



| Channel        | Purpose                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| #recruiters    | Main channel for coordination purposes within the Recruitment Team |
| #tests         | Recruiters will post in this channel when they require pilots to join in for a Practical Test (Tower or Radar). Testers available for the test can "react" to the post to indicate attendance. If all available slots are already filled, Testers **must not**{.red} "react" to the request |
| #tester [VC]   | This can be used for test participants as a general lounge or operationally to coordinate during an active test. All feedback **should**{.red} still given in writing via the test topic |
| #trainers      | Main channel for coordination purposes within the Training Team |
| #training      | Trainers will use this channel to create a topic for each scheduled training session. This is where training session objectives, assignments, and feedback will be given |
| #training-time | Trainers will post in this channel when they require pilots to join in for a training session. Pilots available for the session can "react" to the post to indicate attendance. If all available slots are already filled, Pilots **must not**{.red} "react" to the request |
| #trainer [VC]  | This can be used for participants as a general lounge or operationally to coordinate during an active training session. All feedback **should**{.red} still given in writing via the training topic |



> All test session coordination **must**{.red} take place in the designated channel as directed by the Recruiter



## Recruit User Notes and Activity Checks

### 7C.1.6

Recruiters **must**{.red} add user notes for any performance related issues during the recruitment process (including contact attempts and ban/termination). This ensures that there is an accurate summary displayed if the need arose for a review or there was an appeal on any decision made. In addition, Recruiters **should**{.red} do a comprehensive review of their list of Recruits at least once a month to check for activity. Both of these functions can be done by following the steps below:



Step 1

: Go to the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.infiniteflight.com) and login using your IFC credentials (if required, login is normally automatic)



Step 2

: From the navigation bar on the left of the screen, select "ATC Dashboard" under "IFATC"



Step 3

: Recruiters will be able to see a summary of their Recruits, and what stage they are each at



Step 4

: Select the purple arrow that is inline with the name of the Recruit that you would like to look at, this will open their "ATC" profile



Step 5

: The top navigation bar can then be used to navigate through the different tabs pertaining to that profile, and in particular, "User Notes" can be selected if a note is required



> Recruiters **must**{.red} ensure they use the "IFATC" label for notes that are related to recruitment



Tip

: Alternatively, you can select the "Recruits" tab from the navigation bar on the left of the screen and then search for the Recruit to access their profile



## Returning IFATC Members

### 7C.1.7

Returning members of IFATC **must**{.red} apply in the same manner as all Recruits, with the normal Profile Verification completed to ensure they are still eligible to join.

> Returning members of IFATC are not required to complete the Tower Written Test if they submit an application to join within 1 year of leaving IFATC, therefore Recruiters may need to utilize the "Skip to Training/Practical" buttons as appropriate
