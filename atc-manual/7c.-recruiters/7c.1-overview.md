# 7C.1 Overview



### 7C.1.1

The Recruitment Team (Recruiters) have two main responsibilities, these are to manage new entrants during the recruitment process to join IFATC and secondly, to administer all theory and practical tests, with the final say on the result of the test (i.e. pass/fail).



### 7C.1.2

Recruiters are selected by the IFATC Manager based on a number of criteria, including, but not limited to:



- ATC theoretical knowledge & practical application


- time zone availability
- standing within IFATC
- and/or contributions to the IFATC team as a whole



### 7C.1.3 

The following table outlines the minimum notice period that **must**{.red} be given to a Candidate/Controller before their Initial or Radar Practical Test (including the test location):



| Test Type | Minimum Notice Period |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| Initial   | No minimum            |
| Radar     | 24 hours*             |
