# 7C.5 Practical Test



## Tower

### 7C.5.1

Once the Tower Written Test has been successfully passed, the Recruit can move onto the Tower Practical Test *(see [7B.1](/guide/atc-manual/7b.-testers/7b.1-testing-process#7b.1-testing-process) and [7B.2](/guide/atc-manual/7b.-testers/7b.2-initial-testing#7b.2-initial-testing) above)*. Recruiters **must**{.red} ensure that the Recruit is provided with adequate notice, including a time and location of the test once this has been agreed *(see [7C.4.6](/guide/atc-manual/7c.-recruiters/7c.4-recruiter-admin#7c.4.6) below)*. If the Recruit has been trained by the Recruiter, another Recruiter **should**{.red} administer the test *(see [7C.1.4](/guide/atc-manual/7c.-recruiters/7c.1-overview#7c.1.4) above)*.



Once the Tower Practical Test has been completed, the Recruiter **must**{.red} inform the Recruit of the result. The following wait periods are required if a Recruit does not pass:



| Performance  | Wait Period before Retake |
| ------------ | ------------------------- |
| Poor         | 30 days                   |
| Marginal     | 14 days                   |
| Undetermined | Recruiter Discretion      |

> Three failed attempts at the Tower Practical Test results in a 90 day wait period to restart the process. A "no show" to a scheduled test does not constitute an attempt however will result in a 14 day wait period before retake unless a valid reason (as determined by the Recruiter) is given. A subsequent "no show" will result in termination of the recruitment process. Recruiters **must**{.red} ensure that they document everything in the Recruit's "User Notes" *(see [7C.2.3](/guide/atc-manual/7c.-recruiters/7c.2-recruitment-process-(initial)#7c.2.3) above)*.



### 7C.5.2

Provided that both the Tower Written and Practical Tests have been passed, the Recruit can be invited to join the IFATC Team *(see [7C.4.7](/guide/atc-manual/7c.-recruiters/7c.4-recruiter-admin#7c.4.7) below)*. 



## Radar

### 7C.5.3

Once the Radar Written Test has been successfully passed, the Recruit can move onto the Radar Practical Test following permission from their Trainer *(see [7B.1](/guide/atc-manual/7b.-testers/7b.1-testing-process#7b.1-testing-process) and [7B.3](/guide/atc-manual/7b.-testers/7b.3-radar-testing#7b.3-radar-testing) above)*. Recruiters **must**{.red} ensure that the Recruit is provided with adequate notice, including a time and location of the test once this has been agreed *(see [7C.1.3](/guide/atc-manual/7c.-recruiters/7c.1-overview#7c.1.3) above)*. If the Recruit has been trained by the Recruiter, another Recruiter **should**{.red} administer the test *(see [7C.1.4](/guide/atc-manual/7c.-recruiters/7c.1-overview#7c.1.4) above)*.



> If the Recruit is part of the *#testers* group, they **must**{.red} be removed **BEFORE** commencement of the test. Recruiters **must**{.red} post in *#recruiters* with adequate notice to allow a Moderator the time to remove the individual - once the test is completed, they can be re-added in the same way



Once the Radar Practical test has been completed, the Recruiter **must**{.red} inform the Recruit of the result. The following wait periods are required if a Recruit does not pass:



| Performance  | Wait Period before Retake |
| ------------ | ------------------------- |
| Poor         | 30 days                   |
| Marginal     | 14 days                   |
| Undetermined | Recruiter Discretion      |

> Three failed attempts at the Radar Practical Test results in a 90 day wait period (although restarting the process is not required and can continue after the wait period expires) 



### 7C.5.4

Provided that both the Radar Written and Practical Tests have been passed, the Recruit can be promoted to the rank of Officer  *(see [7C.4.7](/guide/atc-manual/7c.-recruiters/7c.4-recruiter-admin#7c.4.7) below)*.
