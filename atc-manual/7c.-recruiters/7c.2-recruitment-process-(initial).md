# 7C.2 Recruitment Process (Initial)



WORK IN PROGRESS



### 7C.2.1

Once a Candidate has been selected, a display page that provides all of the Candidate's information will pop up. It is the responsibility of the Recruiter to verify that the Candidate meets the following requirements:



- Trust Level 1 on the IFC and in good standing
- At least 14 years of age
- Minimum stats to enter Expert Server (Grade 3)
- No more than 50% violation to landings ratio
- Minimum of 500 ATC operations
- At least 60 days since last Level 2 and/or 3 Violation
- Valid email address (for Slack addition purposes)



Verfication of the above requirements can be assisted using the [ATC Portal](http://infinite-flight-admin.cloudapp.net/mod-admin/login.aspx?redirect=~/mod-admin/mainpage.aspx). Login credentials are provided on joining the Recruitment Team. If a Candidate fails to meet the requirements outlined above, the application **must**{.red} be denied. If the Candidate is sucessful, then the 'Accept Assignment' button can be selected *(see 7C.2.3.1 below)*.

### 7C.2.4

After Candidates have been verified, they are then granted clearance to take the Initial Theory Test. This is done through the pre-formatted template sent to the Candidate via the 'Accept Assignment' button, which takes the Recruiter to the IFC and loads a message to send when ready. 		

Recruiters **must**{.red} ensure that the [Classmarker Link](https://www.classmarker.com/online-test/start/?quiz=x9v565cbee44cdad) to the Initial Theory Test **AND** a valid test code (a number of which is provided by the IFATC Manager upon request) is included in the initial message. Additional relevant information and/or commentary may be provided at the Recruiter's discretion.

Once a Candidate has taken the Initial Theory Test, the final score will determine whether or not the process can continue. A **pass mark of 80% or more must**{.red} be acheived to move onto the Initial Practical Test. The following wait periods are required if a Candidate does not pass:



| Score    | Wait Period before Retake |
| -------- | ------------------------- |
| 00 - 49% | 30 days                   |
| 50 - 79% | 14 days                   |

â€‹	

Three failed attempts at the Initial Theory Test results in a 90 day wait period to restart the process. This may be modified at Recruiter and/or IFATC Manager discretion if necessary. 	



### 7C.2.5

Once the Initial Theory Test has been successfully passed, the Candidate can move onto the Initial Practical Test *(see [7B.1](/guide/atc-manual/7b.-testers/7b.1-testing-process#7b.1-testing-process) and [7B.2](/guide/atc-manual/7b.-testers/7b.2-local-testing#7b.2-local-testing) above)*. Recruiters **must**{.red} ensure that the Candidate is provided with adoquate notice, including a time and location of the test once this has been agreed.

Once the Initial Practical test has been completed, the Recruiter will inform the Candidate of the result by either a DM on the IFC and/or the recording of feedback on the IFATC Website. The following wait periods are required if a Candidate does not pass:



| Performance  | Wait Period before Retake |
| ------------ | ------------------------- |
| Poor         | 30 days                   |
| Marginal     | 14 days                   |
| Undetermined | Recruiter Discretion      |

Three failed attempts at the Initial Practical Test results in a 90 day wait period to restart the process. 



### 7C.2.6

Provided that both the Initial Theory and Practical Tests have been passed, the Candidate can be invited to join the IFATC Team. The IFATC Manager **must**{.red} be provided with the following information in the #recruiter Slack channel:



- display name
- valid email address
