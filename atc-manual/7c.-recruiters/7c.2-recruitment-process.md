+++ Radar Recruit

> The radar certification process is relatively straightforward as a Recruiter - they are only to provide and coordinate the Radar Written and Practical Tests whenever a Trainer clears a Trainee to take either. Recruiters need not concern themselves with any particulars outside of those two functions, though they reserve the right to terminate the radar process of a Trainee if necessary



Step 1

: Go to the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.infiniteflight.com) and login using your IFC credentials (if required, login is normally automatic)



Step 2
