# 7C.3 Verification



### 7C.3.1

Once a Recruit has applied, an initial verification will check if the application meets the minimum criteria, these are:



- **Trust Level 1** on the IFC Forum and in good standing
- At least 14 years of age or as specified by [Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040724612-Why-is-Discord-asking-for-my-birthday-) for their country
- Minimum stats to enter Expert Server (i.e. Grade 3)
- Infinite Flight Account **must**{.red} be linked to IFC account in-app
- **All-time** stats do not exceed 50% Level 1 Violation to landings ratio
- Minimum of 500 ATC operations
- At least 60 days since last Level 2 and/or 3 Violation



If these checks are successful, the application is then reviewed by a Moderator to check for any duplicate accounts and their IFC profile for a potential history that may deem them unfit to join. Once this is approved, the application will then be sent to the "Review Waitlist" for Recruiters to assign themselves.
