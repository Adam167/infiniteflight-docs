# 1B.2  Violation Reasons

 

### 1B.2.1

Some of the possible scenarios that could result in a Violation being issued are listed below:



 -    Not following procedures broadcast on ATIS or in a published TFR/NOTAM
 -    Pushback/taxiing without clearance
 -    Crashing/taxiing into other aircraft/buildings/objects*
 -    Taking-off/landing from a taxiway or grass
 -    Entering the runway without clearance
 -    Taking-off/landing without clearance
 -    Not following the issued sequence
 -    Not following the cleared altitude/heading/speed
 -    Pilots who do not respond to an instruction after 2-3 attempts**
 -    Pilots sending duplicate messages or unnecessary requests 
 -    Spamming a frequency
 -    Repeated disruption
 -    Insulting or inappropriate call-signs/usernames or flight path/plan(s)
 -    Call-signs/usernames with profanity or discriminating/racist terms
 -    Excessive speed in the airport environment***



**Rendering issues may mean that aircraft did not see the other aircraft/buildings/objects, care should be taken to ensure that violations are only issued for aircraft that have blatantly done it on purpose*



***Aircraft descending via VNAV may be issued a violation after a warning if they are unresponsive **AND** conflict with others*



****Speed which results in rapid closure with other aircraft, loss of separation, or airspace disruption may be deemed “excessive”. Good judgment **must**{.red} be used*



> Fighter aircraft **must not**{.red} exceed 350KIAS when below 10,000ft and under ATC control, however pilots are expected to maintain a reasonable speed in the vicinity of other aircraft or when instructed to slow down by Controllers. Reporting for excessive speed can be issued when a lack of etiquette is shown. Standard speed restrictions for commercial aircraft also apply to military cargo aircraft (i.e. maximum 250 KIAS when below 10,000ft and under ATC control)



### 1B.2.2

A full list of the in-app options that can be selected for each position are listed below (including the Violation Level that the pilot will receive); however, it is important to note that Controllers **must not**{.red} pick a reason in order to decide if the pilot gets a Level 2 or Level 3 Violation. Each Violation is specifically paired with a Level, therefore Controllers **must**{.red} pick the correct reason and allow the system to automatically decide what Level Violation is issued:
