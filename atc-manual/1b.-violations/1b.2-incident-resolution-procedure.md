# 1B.2  Incident Resolution Procedure

 

### 1B.2.1    

Controllers **must**{red} keep their replays following a controlling session for a **MINIMUM**{red} of 7 days, those that wish to raise a Violation complaint and/or query are expected to contact the Controller within this time frame. If a complaint/query is raised after 7 days, it is the responsibility of the complainant to provide the necessary evidence (usually with a pilot replay).



### 1B.2.2    

In order to maintain consistency and to deescalate conflicts on the IFC Forum, the following procedure **must**{red} be followed at all times when dealing with Violation complaints and/or queries:

 

\-    The only place incidents may be resolved is on the IFC Forum. Any posts on IFFG or similar fan groups should be politely directed to the IFC Forum without addressing the actual complaint/query

\-    When a complaint/query is posted on the IFC Forum you **must not**{red} respond – inform the Controller in the #discussions channel on Slack by tagging them

\-    When the Controller in question is available, they will respond to the complaint/query (it is recommended that this is done via DM)

\-    Any Controller that is unsure on how best to respond (and particularly new Controllers) **must**{red} contact a Supervisor or above via Slack before posting on the IFC Forum (it is important that the initial response from the Controller addresses the issue in its entirety and is factually correct)

\-    If the incident has not been successfully resolved by all parties involved, then an IFC Moderator can be added to deescalate the situation by tagging @appeals in the DM (assuming one has not already been added)

\-    Controllers **must not**{red} engage in an argument or use definitive phrases such as ‘this Violation will not be reversed’, IFC Moderators will handle this

 

### 1B.2.3    

If you are **NOT THE CONTROLLER INVOLVED**{red} you **must not**{red} respond.
