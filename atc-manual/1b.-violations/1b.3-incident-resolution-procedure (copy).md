# 1B.3  Incident Resolution Procedure

 

### 1B.3.1    

Controllers **must**{.red} keep their replays following a controlling session for a **MINIMUM** of 7 days in case it is required for incident resolution, those that wish to raise a Violation Appeal and/or query are expected to contact the Controller or Appeals Team (on the IFC) within this time frame. If an appeal/query is raised after 7 days it can no longer be appealed.



### 1B.3.2    

In order to maintain consistency and to deescalate conflicts on the IFC Forum, the following procedure **must**{.red} be followed at all times when dealing with Violation complaints and/or queries:

 

 -    The only place incidents may be resolved is on the IFC Forum. Any posts on IFFG or similar fan groups should be politely directed to the IFC Forum without addressing the actual complaint/query
 -    When a complaint/query is posted on the IFC Forum you **must not**{.red} respond â€“ inform the Controller in the *#discussions* channel on Discord by tagging them
 -    When the Controller in question is available, they will respond to the complaint/query (it is recommended that this is done via DM)
 -    Any Controller that is unsure on how best to respond (and particularly new Controllers) **must**{.red} contact a Supervisor or above via Discord before posting on the IFC Forum (it is important that the initial response from the Controller addresses the issue in its entirety and is factually correct)
 -    If the incident has not been successfully resolved by all parties involved, then the Appeals Team will be required to assist in deescalation. This can be done by adding *@appeals* to the DM (not by tagging) on the IFC Forum
 -    In the event that both the Controller and the Appeals Team are added to the DM, the Controller **must**{.red} observe only and allow the Appeals Team to deal with the appeal. If input is required by the Controller, the Appeals Team member dealing with the appeal will privately message the Controller
 -    Controllers **must not**{.red} engage in an argument or use definitive phrases such as "this Violation will not be reversed", Appeals Team members will handle this



### 1B.3.3    

If you are **NOT THE CONTROLLER INVOLVED** you **must not**{.red} respond.
