# 7E.3 Escalation Process



### 7E.3.1

When an appeal cannot be resolved independently or with the help of additional Appeals Team members via the *#appeals* Discord Channel, an Appeals Team member **should**{.red} request assistance from an IFC Moderator to provide a final determination (where necessary, the final authority for all appeals is with Infinite Flight Staff members).



### 7E.3.2

Any IFC member submitting an Appeal is expected to remain calm, courteous, and respectful. Abusive language or behavior will not be tolerated and **should**{.red} be "flagged" so that it can be brought to the attention of IFC Moderators who will close the Appeal.



### 7E.3.3

If Appeals Team members feel it is necessary to provide Controller feedback following an Appeal, or notice consistent violation reversals for the same Controller, they **should**{.red}:



Step 1

: Raise this in the *#appeals* Discord Channel to reach a consensus with other members



Step 2

: If it is deemed to be a potential issue the Controller can be spoken to directly to try and establish the root cause (and if appropriate, provide corrective feedback)



Step 3

: Document this by going to the [website](https://if-atc.com) and logging in via the "Dashboard"



Step 4

: Select "Controllers" from the navigation bar at the top of the screen



Step 5

: Utilize the "search" function to find the Controller



Step 6

: Select their name from under IFC and then "notes" from the navigation bar on their profile



Step 7

: Applicable notes can be added (we recommended starting with "From Appeals:" so that it is clear) and then saved by clicking "Add Note"



Step 8

: If the Appeals Team member feels that the Controller was not receptive to feedback, the issue continues and/or any other reason they feel makes it necessary, this can escalated by bringing it to the attention of an IFC Moderator
