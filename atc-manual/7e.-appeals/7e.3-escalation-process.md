# 7E.3 Escalation Process



### 7E.3.1

When an appeal cannot be resolved independently or with the help of additional Appeals Team members via the *#appeals* Discord Channel, an Appeals Team member **should**{.red} request assistance from an IFC Moderator to provide a final determination. The final authority for all appeals is with Infinite Flight Staff members where necessary. 



### 7E.3.2

Any IFC member submitting an appeal is expected to remain calm, courteous, and respectful. Abusive language or behavior should result in a closed appeal and may be brought to the attention of IFC Moderators for additional action when needed.
