# 7E.3 Escalation Process



### 7E.3.1

When an appeal cannot be resolved independently or with the help of additional Appeals Team members via the *#appeals* Discord Channel, an Appeals Team member **should**{.red} request assistance from an IFC Moderator to provide a final determination (where necessary, the final authority for all appeals is with Infinite Flight Staff members).



### 7E.3.2

Any IFC member submitting an Appeal is expected to remain calm, courteous, and respectful. Abusive language or behavior will not be tolerated and **should**{.red} be "flagged" so that it can be brought to the attention of IFC Moderators who will close the Appeal.



### 7E.3.3

If Appeals Team members feel it is necessary to provide Controller feedback following an Appeal, or notice consistent violation reversals for the same Controller, they **should**{.red}:



Step 1

: Raise this in the *#appeals* Discord Channel to reach a consensus with other members



Step 2

: If it is deemed to be a potential issue the Controller can be spoken to directly to try and establish the root cause (and if appropriate, provide corrective feedback)



Step 3

: Document this by going to the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.infiniteflight.com) and logging in using your IFC credentials (if required, login is normally automatic)



Step 4

: From the navigation bar on the left of the screen, select "Users" if not already selected



Step 5

: Use the search function to find either the Discord or IFC username



Step 6

: Select the arrow on the right of the screen that is inline with the name of the User that you would like to look at, this will open their profile



Step 7

: The top navigation bar can then be used to navigate through the different tabs pertaining to that profile, and in particular, "User Notes" can be selected if a note is required



Tip

: When adding notes, it is recommended to start with "From Appeals:" so that it is clear who has written the note



Step 8

: Click "Add Note" to save it



> If the Appeals Team member feels that the Controller was not receptive to feedback, the issue continues and/or any other reason they feel makes it necessary, this can be escalated by bringing it to the attention of an IFC Moderator
