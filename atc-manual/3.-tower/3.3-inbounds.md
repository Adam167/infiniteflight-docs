# 3.3 Inbounds



## Pattern Entry, Sequence and Clearance



### 3.3.1

When there is no Radar Controller present, Tower **must**{.red} issue a pattern entry and clearance to **ALL**{.red} aircraft as a **MINIMUM**{.red}, regardless of what the aircraft uses to check in on the Tower frequency (the use of sequencing will be dependent on traffic). In addition, Controllers may wish to take into account the aircraft flight plan (in particular the STAR) when issuing the pattern entry, however; traffic flow and common sense **should**{.red} also be considered (i.e. if the STAR leads an aircraft into a straight in, but due to traffic it would be better for the aircraft to enter downwind; then Controllers **should**{.red} be proactive in managing this).



### 3.3.2

Controllers may delay issuing a sequence number if they are unsure where the traffic will fit into the pattern, however when this becomes more clear, Controllers **must**{.red} issue this to give aircraft adequate time to adjust their course.



## Runway Changes



### 3.3.3

Controllers **should**{.red} try to accommodate aircraft requests for different runways, provided it does not compromise the level of service given to other aircraft



### 3.3.4

If a runway change is issued, a new pattern entry and clearance **must**{.red} be given (the use of sequencing will be depedent on traffic).



## Cleared for the Option



### 3.3.5    

If an aircraft is in the pattern ‘Cleared for the Option’ **must**{.red} be used as it gives the pilot the option of a landing / touch & go / stop & go or low approach.



### 3.3.6

If the aircraft has already been instructed to make left/right traffic from the initial take-off clearance or the previous landing clearance, then the use of ‘make left/right traffic’ is no longer required to be used as it is assumed the pilot will continue with this pattern unless told otherwise. If the pilot is given a new pattern entry or new runway, when clearing for the option, you **must**{.red} tell the pilot whether to make left/right traffic.
