# 3.5  Tower working with Radar

 

### 3.5.1    

Communication is key to ensure that you work together, offering the best possible service. Typically at busy times, the Radar Controllers are trained to use **ALL**{.red} the available runways, and offer spacing of 5nm between arrivals to allow for a departure in between. You **should**{.red} communicate with the Controller if you are concerned about a departure queue building and need more space but it is likely that the Radar Controller will monitor this and adjust arrivals accordingly. You **must** **not**{.red} dictate to the Radar Controller which runways **should**{.red} be used for arrivals vs departures, **ALL**{.red} runways **should**{.red} be used *(see 4.1.1 below).*



### 3.5.2    

Pattern work **must**{.red} stay with Tower, and **must not**{.red} be handed over to the Radar Controller unless it has been decided to deny pattern work; in which case, those aircraft that are in the pattern can be converted into a radar pattern by handing them over to the Radar Controller.

 

### 3.5.3    

Below is a table that summarises when to use pattern entries, sequences and clearances:

 

| **Approach  Type** | **Pattern Entry** | **Sequence** | **Clearance** |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| ILS/GPS            | No                | No           | Yes           |
| Radar Vectors      | Yes               | If  Req      | Yes           |
| Flight Following   | Yes               | If  Req      | Yes           |
| Visual             | No                | If  Req      | Yes           |



When there is no Radar Controller present, Tower **must**{.red} issue a pattern entry and clearance to **ALL**{.red} aircraft as a **MINIMUM**{.red}, regardless of what the aircraft uses to check in on the Tower frequency. The use of sequencing will be dependent on traffic.
