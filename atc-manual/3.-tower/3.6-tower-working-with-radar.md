# 3.6  Tower working with Radar

 

### 3.6.1    

Communication is key to ensure that you work together, offering the best possible service. Typically at busy times, the Radar Controllers are trained to use **ALL**{.red} the available runways, and offer spacing of 5nm between arrivals to allow for a departure in between. You **should**{.red} communicate with the Controller if you are concerned about a departure queue building and need more space but it is likely that the Radar Controller will monitor this and adjust arrivals accordingly. You **must not**{.red} dictate to the Radar Controller which runways **should**{.red} be used for arrivals vs. departures, **ALL**{.red} runways **should**{.red} be used *(see [4.1.1](/guide/atc-manual/4.-atis/4.1-atis#4.1.1) below)*. In addition, once aircraft have been handed over to Tower, runway changes **should**{.red} be kept to a minimum for instrument arrivals.



### 3.6.2    

Pattern work **must**{.red} stay with Tower, and **must not**{.red} be handed over to the Radar Controller unless it has been decided to deny pattern work; in which case, those aircraft that are in the pattern can be converted into a radar pattern by handing them over to the Radar Controller.

 

### 3.6.3    

Below is a table that summarizes when to use pattern entries, sequences and clearances (when Radar is present):

 

| **Approach  Type** | **Pattern Entry** | **Sequence** | **Clearance** |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| ILS/GPS            | No                | No           | Yes           |
| Radar Vectors      | Yes               | If  Req      | Yes           |
| Flight Following   | Yes               | If  Req      | Yes           |
| Visual             | No                | If  Req      | Yes           |
