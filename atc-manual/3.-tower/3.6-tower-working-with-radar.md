# 3.6  Tower working with Radar

 

### 3.6.1    

Communication is key to ensure that you work together, offering the best possible service. Typically at busy times, the Radar Controllers are trained to use **ALL** the available runways, and offer spacing of 5nm between arrivals to allow for a departure in between. You **should**{.red} communicate with the Controller if you are concerned about a departure queue building and need more space but it is likely that the Radar Controller will monitor this and adjust arrivals accordingly. You **must not**{.red} dictate to the Radar Controller which runways **should**{.red} be used for arrivals vs. departures, **ALL** runways **should**{.red} be used *(see [4.2.1](/guide/atc-manual/4.-atis/4.2-remarks-and-notams#4.2.1) below)*. In addition, once aircraft have been handed over to Tower, runway changes **should**{.red} be kept to a minimum for instrument arrivals.



Tip

: When Tower Controllers have finished their session and are handing over to a new Tower Controller, it is recommended to use the same frequency unless it has been agreed with the Radar Controller which frequency will be used after the switch - this helps ensure the frequency change quick commands are unaffected during the Controller changeover



### 3.6.2    

Pattern work **must**{.red} stay with Tower, and **must not**{.red} be handed over to the Radar Controller unless it has been decided to deny pattern work; in which case, those aircraft that are in the pattern can be converted into a radar pattern by handing them over to the Radar Controller. It will then be up to the Radar Controller's discretion to decide if they can accept radar pattern work based on their workload (consideration **should**{.red} also be given to the Tower Controller's workload such as a long departure line).

 

### 3.6.3    

Below is a table that summarizes when to use pattern entries, sequences and clearances (when Radar is present):

 

| Approach Type    | Pattern Entry | Sequence | Clearance |
| ---------------- | ------------- | -------- | --------- |
| ILS/GPS          | No            | No       | Yes       |
| Radar Vectors    | Yes           | If  Req  | Yes       |
| Flight Following | Yes           | If  Req  | Yes       |
| Visual           | No            | If  Req  | Yes       |

> "If req" means that unless the aircraft is number 1, a sequence is **required** before issuing the clearance
