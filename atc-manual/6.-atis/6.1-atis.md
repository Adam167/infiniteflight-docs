# 6.1 ATIS

 

Tip

: Controllers **should** avoid adding too many REMARKS and NOTAMS into a single ATIS as this will dilute the message – controllers **should** ask themselves what the most important messages are, and prioritise as required *(see 6.1.6 below)*



### 6.1.1    

The ATIS enables the controllers to broadcast the current weather as well as REMARKS and NOTAMS for pilots to be aware of. **ALL** available runways **should** be used – one runway for departures and another runway for arrivals **should** be avoided if possible. Controllers may however, be exposed to an airport where terrain, airport layout or weather prevents **ALL** runways from being used; in this case it is acceptable to not use **ALL** runways (if there are any doubts as to what strategy **should** be used, controllers **should** raise this with a Supervisor or above for guidance).



### 6.1.2    

Pattern work **must** be denied if the weather conditions, terrain or traffic are not suitable *(see 5.3 above)*



### 6.1.3    

A letter of the Phonetic Alphabet is used to identify an ATIS transmission, this letter is then relayed between pilots and controllers to ensure everyone is operating under the same airfield information. At any time, if the current ATIS does not reflect the current situation (including changes in weather), controllers **must** change the ATIS without delay and relay this to the other controllers involved. As a **MINIMUM**, the ATIS must be updated at least once an hour. In addition, a broadcast **must** be made on Ground/Tower to ensure pilots check the new ATIS.



### 6.1.4    

The letters used when updating the ATIS **must** be in alphabetical order and typically starts at Alpha unless the controller has just taken over from another controller, or a short period of uncontrolled time has elapsed at the airfield.



### 6.1.5    

The facility to open multiple Ground/Tower/Radar frequencies exist at some airports. This can be useful when managing busy traffic. If this is to be used controllers **must** ensure that the ATIS is updated to reflect this (i.e. which frequency to contact, from which direction), prior coordination is made with the other controllers; and during the controlling session, communication facilities such as slack are used to provide a good service.

 

### 6.1.6    

The table below highlights when certain REMARKS or NOTAMS **should** be used:

 

| **REMARK  / NOTAM**   | **When  to be used?**                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| No Intersection Dept. | Intersection departures **must** always be allowed unless it  blocks the only taxiway for aircraft to access full length **AND** will affect the departure/arrival flow rate *(see 5.2.4 above)*. |
| No Pattern Work       | When weather is below VMC minima or if the  controller has decided it is not suitable based on other conditions such as  traffic or terrain *(see 5.3 above)*. |
| Flow Control          | Aircraft can expect a delay for departure if  the controller is trying to limit departing traffic (this could be due to  aircraft all heading for the same destination). |
| Long Taxi             | If the runways in use mean that some aircraft  can expect a long taxi. |
| Gate Hold             | The use of hold position *(see 4.1.3 above)* **should** be favoured but if a long line of  departures needs to be cleared and you have limited space on the taxiways,  gate hold can be used (it **should** be limited to a maximum of 10 minutes). |
| No Light Aircraft     | This command is for large hub airports (such as EGLL, OMDB  and VHHH) where it is not appropriate to have light aircraft at any time (i.e. the airport  does not accept light aircraft IRL) and their presence could cause undue delay  to all other aircraft due to their speed characteristics. Therefore, at large hub airports, this command **must**  be used at **ALL** times, it is  not traffic dependant – a consistent message **must** be sent that there are other,  more appropriate airports for *light aircraft. |
| Rolling Dept.         | To expedite departures – when aircraft are  cleared for take-off they will be expected to line up and start their  take-off roll immediately. Do not use the LUAW command when in use. |
| FPL Required          | Only to be used when weather is below VMC  minima *(see 5.3 above)*. |
| Straight Out Dept.    | Runway heading **must** be flown after departure  until no conflict exists **AND**  the altitude specified by the tower controller has been met or exceeded *(see 5.2.7 above)*. |
| Mult. Freq. In Use    | *(See 6.1.5 above)*.                                         |
| Check Forum           | Only to be used when referring pilots to  special instructions on the IFC pages e.g. VARB Summit. |
| Event                 | IF LLC sponsored events only.                                |
| Size Restrictions     | Aerodromes that have aircraft size restrictions  *(see 4.1.1 above)*. |
| Severe Weather        | High winds, turbulence and any other weather related phenmena. |
| Low Visibility        | Low Visibility – visibility less than ¼  statute miles (400m). |

 

*For the purposes of IF, ‘light’ aircraft are defined as the C172, SR22, XCub and Spitfire Mk VIII.
