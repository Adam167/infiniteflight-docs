# 7D.3 Check Ride Process



### 7D.3.1

When a Controller enters the Check Ride phase *(see [7.4](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.4-promotion-to-specialist-(check-ride)#7.4-promotion-to-specialist-(check-ride)) above)*, an automatic message will be sent to the #atcsupervisors channel every time the Controller opens a frequency. As part of the Check Ride phase, Supervisors **should**{.red} make attempts to observe and/or fly for Controllers under review, this is to ensure that a certain quality and level of suitable improvement exists.



### 7D.3.2

Following attendance of a Controllers session, Supervisors **should**{.red} click on the 'HERE' link provided by the IFATC Website Bot. This action will take Supervisors to the “Sessions” tab of controller(s) who are currently undergoing their Check Ride, located directly on the [IFATC Website](https://if-atc.com).	

Once there, Supervisors are able to make notes on the performance of Controllers by hitting the “Sessions” button directly above the Session Date / Feedback line. They are then sent to the following template *(see 7D.3.2.1 below)*:

Based upon Controller performance during an individual Check Ride session, Supervisors **must**{.red} fill out the template and provide feedback as appropriate.



### 7D.3.3

At the end of a Controller’s probationary period, the IFATC Manager will review the feedback conducted by Supervisors at Check Ride sessions *(see [7.4.5](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.4-promotion-to-specialist-(check-ride)#7.4.5) above)*. A decision will be made and repeated if necessary.
