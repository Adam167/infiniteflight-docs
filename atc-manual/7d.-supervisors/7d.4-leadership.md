# 7D.4 Leadership



### 7D.4.1

Accountability exists for everyone within the team, and therefore Controllers are expected to utilize any feedback given to improve. Supervisors **should**{.red} make every effort to give both positive and negative feedback to Controllers (even if they are not in the Check Ride phase). When the opportunity exists and if deemed necessary *(see [7D.4.4](/guide/atc-manual/7d.-supervisors/7d.4-leadership#7d.4.4) below)*, Supervisors can add a "note" to the Controller's record on the [website](https://if-atc.com) by following the steps below:



Step 1

: Go to [website](https://if-atc.com) and login via the "Dashboard"



Step 2

: Select "Controllers" from the navigation bar at the top of the screen



Step 3

: Utilize the "search" function to find the Controller



Step 4

: Select their name from under IFC and then "notes" from the navigation bar on their profile



Step 5

: Applicable notes can be added and then saved by clicking "Add Note"



### 7D.4.2

When offering guidance to team members, be sure to emphasize that Controllers never stop learning and that any setbacks and/or criticisms **should**{.red} be taken in their stride. 



### 7D.4.3

Supervisors may assist in general matters within IFATC, but must leave other sensitive requests to the appropriate groups (i.e. violations to Moderators, recruiting questions to Recruiters and training to Trainers). 



### 7D.4.4

It is highly encouraged that Supervisors use the "note" function to record both positive and negative feedback for Controllers. This is always taken into consideration when Controllers are considered for promotions within IFATC and therefore (no matter how minor), will help track trends or potential issues that may arise in the future. Supervisors **should**{.red} take note that, by definition, an absence of negative notes indicates a good track record.
