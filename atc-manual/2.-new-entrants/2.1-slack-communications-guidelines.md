# 2.1  Slack Communication Guidelines

 

## 2.1.1    

Slack is a messenger app for teams to make work simpler, more pleasant and more productive. Please visit https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us to learn more about how this app works.



## 2.1.2    

Group chats are authorized as long as they do not diminish effectiveness of primary channels. Controllers are encouraged to utilize group messages or threads for specific interest groups amongst controllers. Slack rules will still be enforced if an issue is brought to the attention of a Supervisor or above.

 

## 2.1.3   

 The channels and their use is outlined in the table below:

 

| **Channel**    | **Purpose**                                                  |
| -------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| #controllers   | All normal controller communications to occur  in this channel. This channel **should** **not** be used unless ***ACTIVELY\***  controlling. |
| #discussions   | A space for mature dialogue about Infinite  Flight and aviation related topics for active controllers. Moderate off topic  conversation is acceptable but **should** be kept to a minimum. |
| #readonly      | News, updates and important team  announcements to be made on this channel by the ATC Community Manager and  Moderators only. Controllers **must not** reply to  any material posted in this channel so that all controllers can be reached  effectively. |
| #flights       | This channel will be used for controllers to  coordinate group flights together. All coordination **should** remain in this channel. |
| #issues        | Any issues that occur that specifically  involve controlling **should** be placed in this channel with the  following information included:  -      Specific issue  -      UTC time issue occurred  -      Pilot username / callsign involved  -      Controller username  -      ATC facility |
| #training-time | Trainers  will post in this channel when they require pilots to join in for training  sessions, the relevant instructions are pinned within the channel. |
