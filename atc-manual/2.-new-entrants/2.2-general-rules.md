# 2.2  General Rules

 

Tip

: All controllers **must** ensure that their IFC Username, Slack Display Name, and IF Display Name have a measure of consistency so that they can easily be found if required (see 2.2.1 below)



### 2.2.1    

The following rules **must** be followed at all times:

 

|                          **Slack**                           |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| Your Slack username **must** remain consistent. Please use  your first name, if able. |
| Controllers **must not** share any IFATC material or conversations contained  within the IFATC Slack externally (unless prior approval has been granted). |
| Be respectful to other users and refrain from  profanity & offensive dialogue (including, but not limited to; racist and  sexual comments). |
| Criticism and feedback will generally be  given via DM; however, on occasion, it may be provided publicly if it is  deemed to be a wider issue amongst controllers. |
| Off topic material,  including memes and GIFs, **must not** be used  outside of the #discussions channel. |



|                       **Controlling**                        |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| All controllers **must** announce  in #controllers when opening/closing any frequency on the Expert Server. When closing, a ***MINIMUM\*** of 5 minutes warning and the last ATIS letter used  **must**  be provided. |
| Controllers **must**  control within the bounds of the ATC Schedule posted every week on the IFC  and in #readonly on Slack. The only exception to this is when controllers are  not qualified to do so as per the rank structure *(see 2.4.1 below)*, in which case a sensible alternative can be  selected. |
| Opening frequencies is on a first come, first serve  basis within #controllers. Therefore controllers **should not** reserve frequencies  privately or not open in anticipation of a particular frequency becoming  available. This does not apply to certain events where frequency allocation  may be authorised. |
| Controllers **must not** control on the Training Server *(see 11.4.3  below for exceptions).* |
| Controllers **must not** act as a controller and as a pilot simultaneously  on separate devices, violating Infinite Flight’s Terms & Agreement. |
| Standards of  controlling are closely monitored – **controllers are expected to control within their means,  prioritising quality over quantity** *(see 2.4 below)* |
