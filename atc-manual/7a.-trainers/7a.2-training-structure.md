# 7A.2 Training Structure 



### 7A.2.1

Candidates/Controllers **must**{.red} ensure that all requirements are met before submitting a Training Request Form. These requirements and the full process are outlined in the following locations:

 

| **Trainee Type** | **Location**                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Candidate        | [ATC Training Post](https://community.infiniteflight.com/t/atc-training/416531) on the IFC Forum |
| Controller       | See [7.5](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.5-radar-theory-and-practical-tests#7.5-radar-theory-and-practical-tests) above |



### 7A.2.2

All Trainers **must**{.red} proactively monitor the #trainingrequests channel in Slack for training requests. Trainees **should**{.red} be claimed within a 7 day timeframe by placing a green checkmark emoji at the bottom of each submission.



### 7A.2.3

Once a Trainer has accepted a training request, the Trainer **must**{.red} send a DM to the Trainee via the IFC Forum and/or Slack to begin dialogue and to organize training sessions. All sessions **must**{.red} be added to the [Training Calender](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11xnWvhx1G5Tv-xumqSJP4_qz6j888fJ5M5v6URqvFLA/edit?usp=sharing). Each session is broken down into half hour blocks every day on a weekly basis, allowing for multiple Trainers and Trainees to coordinate their own sessions. The sheet is refreshed every week with the old one(s) being hidden and preserved should any references be required. 	



### 7A.2.4

A first-come, first-served basis is utilized for slots in the Training Calender. Equal priority is shared with respect to the time(s) booked by those who need them (not applicable to testing).	



### 7A.2.5

Posts and/or session coordination regarding training **must**{.red} be posted by Trainers in the [ATC Training Category](https://community.infiniteflight.com/c/training/37) on the IFC Forum and/or #training-time in Slack. Subsequent guidelines on their use is outlined within the category/channel.		



### 7A.2.6

Trainers reserve the right to terminate training at any point *(see [7.1.4](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.1-overview#7.1.4) above)*, however a two-strike policy **should**{.red} be used if a Candidate/Controller fails to respond or communicate with their assigned Trainer(s). Appeals may be reviewed by the Training Team Administrator and/or the IFATC Manager on a case-by-case basis. 



### 7A.2.7

For Local Training, Trainers **must**{.red} conduct training at airports with parallel and/or intersecting runways depending on the circumstances of their Trainees. Additionally, Trainers **must not**{.red} train at test sites in order to avoid any unfair advantages *(see [7B.2](/guide/atc-manual/7b.-testers/7b.2-local-testing#7b.2-local-testing) and [7B.3.2](/guide/atc-manual/7b.-testers/7b.3-radar-testing#7b.3.2) below)*. The following table outlines recommended airports for Radar Training (Trainers are encouraged to rotate through each site on a consistent basis).
