: The Controller can take The Radar Theory Test at any time *(see [7.5.4](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.5-radar-theory-and-practical-tests#7.5.4) above)*, therefore when they are ready, Trainers can message the Recruiter (as listed on the Trainee's profile) that they are ready for the test

Step 3

: The Recruiter will inform the Trainer when the theory test has been completed by the Trainee
