# 5.5  Tower working with Radar

 

### 5.5.1    

Communication is key to ensure that you work together, offering the best possible service. Typically at busy times, the radar controllers are trained to use **ALL** the available runways, and offer spacing of 5nm between arrivals to allow for a departure in between. You **should** communicate with the controller if you are concerned about a departure queue building and need more space but it is likely that the radar controller will monitor this and adjust arrivals accordingly. You **must** **not** dictate to the radar controller which runways **should** be used for arrivals vs departures, **ALL** runways **should** be used *(see 6.1.1 below).*



### 5.5.2    

Pattern work **must** stay with Tower, and **must not** be handed over to the radar controller unless it has been decided to deny pattern work; in which case, those aircraft that are in the pattern can be converted into a radar pattern by handing them over to the radar controller.

 

### 5.5.3    

Below is a table that summarises when to use pattern entries, sequences and clearances:

 

| **Approach  Type** | **Pattern Entry** | **Sequence** | **Clearance** |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| ILS/GPS            | No                | No           | Yes           |
| Radar Vectors      | Yes               | If  Req      | Yes           |
| Flight Following   | Yes               | If  Req      | Yes           |
| Visual             | No                | If  Req      | Yes           |



When there is no Radar controller present, Tower **must** issue a pattern entry and clearance to **ALL** aircraft as a **MINIMUM**, regardless of what the aircraft uses to check in on the Tower frequency. The use of sequencing will be dependent on traffic.
