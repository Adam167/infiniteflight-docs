# 5.4  Cleared for the Option / Exit Runway / Go-Around

 

## Cleared for the Option



### 5.4.1    

If an aircraft is in the pattern ‘Cleared for the Option’ **must** be used as it gives the pilot the option of a landing / touch & go / stop & go or low approach.



### 5.4.2    

If the aircraft has already been instructed to make left/right traffic from the initial take-off clearance or the previous landing clearance, then the use of ‘make left/right traffic’ is no longer required to be used as it is assumed the pilot will continue with this pattern unless told otherwise. If the pilot is given a new pattern entry or new runway, when clearing for the option, you **must** tell the pilot whether to make left/right traffic.



## Exit Runway



### 5.4.3    

The Exit Runway command **should** be given once the aircraft is at a safe and controlled speed (typically less than 70kts). The expedite command **should** not be used unnecessarily. Typically aircraft that are within 2nm final or 3nm final if another aircraft is lined up on the runway to depart, would require the use of this.



## Go-Around 



### 5.4.4    

A ‘go-around’ (G/A) can be pilot or Controller initiated and is the procedure used to cancel the approach and/or landing. Controllers **should** try to be proactive when they see a conflict that requires the use of a go-around. When issuing a go-around instruction, the option of including left/right traffic **should** be used as this gives the pilot an indication of the direction you want them to take. No pattern entry is required however, sequencing (as appropriate) and a clearance will be needed. If working with a Radar Controller, you **should** try to let them know that the aircraft is ‘go-around’ traffic so that they can work them into the plan, the aircraft can then be handed over to the Radar Controller unless they are VFR traffic or a prior arrangement has been made between Controllers.
