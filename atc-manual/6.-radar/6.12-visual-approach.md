# 6.12  Visual Approach

 

### 6.12.1    

A visual approach is an approach to a runway at an aerodrome conducted under IFR but where the pilot proceeds by visual reference when cleared to do so. This means that the pilot **must**{.red} be visual before the Controller can clear the aircraft for the visual approach.



### 6.12.2    

Although similar to Radar Vectors, the underlying difference is that when aircraft are under Radar Vectors, they will not receive an approach clearance. Therefore when aircraft call in following Radar Vectors, Tower would issue a pattern entry, a sequence (if required) and then a clearance. Whereas with the visual approach, they do not require a pattern entry because they have been cleared for the approach, therefore only a sequence (if required) and a clearance is issued by Tower.



### 6.12.3    

There are multiple ways in which a visual approach can be given to the pilot but generally speaking, and terrain permitting; the aircraft **should**{.red} be positioned in a recognizable position such as downwind, base, or even straight in. The Approach Controller must then ask the aircraft to ‘report the airfield in sight’ (note that Controllers can still continue to issue vectors to the pilot after requesting the pilot to ‘report the airfield in sight’). Once the pilot has responded with the airfield in sight, the Approach Controller can clear them for the visual approach (with or without a final vector) and then hand them off to Tower/Unicom as appropriate.



### 6.12.4    

There are some specific procedures for various aerodromes but this relies on both the Controller and pilot using the correct chart. This can be adopted using the same method as already outlined *(see [6.8.6](/guide/atc-manual/6.-radar/6.8-approach#6.8.6) above).*



### 6.12.5    

The Visual Approach at JFK, New York (KJFK) onto RWY13L/R *(see image 6.12.5.1 below)* is a good example of a specific procedure. For this procedure the Controller would need to vector aircraft towards the start which in this case is the Canarsie (CRI) VOR. The chart requires an inbound heading of 043, so a heading of 040 or similar would be appropriate and the minimum altitude for the approach is 2000ft initially. The pilot can then be instructed to report the airport in sight, and once they have, cleared for the visual approach and handed over to Tower. In this particular case, the aircraft would essentially be handed over on a right base for RWY13L/R, however if the pilot fails to report the airport in sight, further vectors may be required to ensure they continue to follow the prescribed tracks until they have confirmed that they are visual with the airport.
