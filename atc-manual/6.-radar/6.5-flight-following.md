# 6.5  Flight Following



### 6.5.1    

Flight Following is a VFR service that can be requested by a pilot with or without a Flight Plan, therefore Controllers can expect pilots to "see and avoid". Radar Controllers can acknowledge this request and if the pilot has a flight plan, they will be expected to continue following it.



> When busy, Flight Following or other VFR services may be denied, however it is recommended you work the traffic when possible to provide vectors away from hazardous areas such as final and busy arrival/departure corridors



### 6.5.2    

Pilots are however, still subject to vectors and altitude assignments as dictated by traffic, Radar Controllers **must**{.red} make this judgment to ensure separation is maintained with the other aircraft in their airspace.



> It is important to note that final separation from other aircraft, terrain, and IMC conditions falls on the pilot, not ATC



### 6.5.3    

If you do issue a vector and/or altitude assignment, once the risk of conflict is no longer present, you **should**{.red} let the pilot know by sending "Continue as Filed" and/or "Altitude at your Discretion" respectively (*see [6.5.5](/guide/atc-manual/6.-radar/6.5-flight-following#6.5.5) below for exceptions)*. "Resume Own Navigation" **should**{.red} be used instead of "Continue as Filed" if the aircraft is no longer expected to return to their flight plan or does not have a flight plan filed. 



### 6.5.4    

A frequency change **should**{.red} be issued when the aircraft is departing your airspace **AND**{.red} will no longer affect any other aircraft that is under your control.



### 6.5.5    

Aircraft under Flight Following **must not**{.red} be asked for their approach request as this is a VFR advisory service with the sole purpose of monitoring their flight and providing traffic alerts **when able**. However, if an aircraft is inbound to an airport that you are controlling and it is busy, you can consider some of the following options to manage your workload (in partnership with the Tower Controller as required):

- issue vectors for the approach sequence before being handed to the Tower Controller
- switch the aircraft early so the Tower Controller can provide entry and sequence instructions
- or place the aircraft on a leg of the pattern for the Tower Controller (similar to Radar Vectors) before handover
