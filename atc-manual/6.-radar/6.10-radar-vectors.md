# 6.10  Radar Vectors

 

### 6.10.1    

Radar Vectors are primarily used to put aircraft into the VFR pattern for an airport. Controllers **should**{.red} vector aircraft into a recognisable position (e.g. downwind, base etc.), and before handing over to Tower, descend the aircraft down to pattern altitude (*see image 6.10.1.1)*. If the runway which is in use has an instrument approach (ILS or GPS), Controllers can vector the aircraft towards the localiser however the aircraft **must**{.red} not be cleared for an approach, but instead handed over to tower who will issue a pattern entry, sequence (if required) and then a clearance.

### 6.10.2    

Controllers **must**{.red} check the Airport Elevation of the airfield they are Radar Vectoring an aircraft to so that the correct pattern altitude can be determined; and as always, consideration to surrounding terrain **must**{.red} be taken into account.



### 6.10.3    

If the weather at the airport in question is below VMC *(see 3.3 above)*, then aircraft **must**{.red} be vectored towards the instrument approach for the airport (ILS or GPS), and then handed over to Tower/Unicom before the intercept. In this case, descent to pattern altitude is not required, but a suitable altitude **should**{.red} be selected taking into account the G/S *(see 6.9.5 above).*
