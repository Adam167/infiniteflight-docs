# 6.9  Global Positioning System (GPS) Approach



@[vimeo](442728868)



### 6.9.1

The Global Positioning System (GPS) Approach is a non-precision approach within IF but is not commonly used as functionality is currently limited. If however, pilots request this type of approach, Controllers **should**{.red} try to accommodate this when traffic permits. The GPS Approach is defined by a series of waypoints and altitude restrictions that the pilot will follow to the runway threshold, free of conventional guidance such as a localizer/glideslope etc.



### 6.9.2

When a pilot requests the GPS Approach, Controllers **must**{.red} check that the aircraft has a published procedure (i.e. denoted by a prefix in their flight plan - *see [6.8.9](/guide/atc-manual/6.-radar/6.8-approach#6.8.9) above*) that provides lateral navigation to the intended arrival runway. Controllers can then expect aircraft to continue on their Flight Plan, and at an appropriate point (such as base), clear the aircraft for the GPS Approach. Vectors, altitude assignments, and/or intercepts **should not**{.red} be required and the pilot is expected to follow their flight plan to the runway threshold.



### 6.9.3

Once the aircraft is inbound to the runway threshold (this may not be inline with the runway for various GPS Approaches that are offset) Controllers can then hand them off to Tower/Unicom as appropriate.
