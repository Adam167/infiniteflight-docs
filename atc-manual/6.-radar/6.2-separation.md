# 6.2 Separation



### 6.2.1    

Terrain separation: aircraft **must**{.red} be provided with at least 1000ft AGL (above ground level) terrain clearance at all times.

 

### 6.2.2    

Aircraft separation: aircraft **must**{.red} be no closer than 3nm laterally or 1000ft vertically at all times *(see 6.2.2.1 below).*

### 6.2.3

If aircraft do not meet separation requirements on initial contact, the Radar Controller **should**{.red} endeavour to provide this separation as soon as practicable. Until the minimum separation requirements are met, any continued flight with less than this is the pilots responsibility - therefore it does not prevent the Controller from offering a service (i.e. "Expect Vectors for...").



### 6.2.4

The collision alert system will alert Controllers of airborne conflicts. If it is believed that the alert is valid then Controllers **must**{.red} immediately issue a traffic alert and, if feasible, offer an immediate alternate course of action to reestablish IFR separate minima.



| Collision Alert              | Criteria            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Red Target                   | <1000ft and/or 3nm  |
| Red Target and Audible Alarm | <500ft and/or 1.5nm |



### 6.2.5

Aircraft receiving a VFR service are expected to "see and avoid" while maintaining a **MINIMUM** of 500ft vertical separation with other aircraft.
