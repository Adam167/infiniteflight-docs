# 6.9  GPS Approach



### 6.9.1

The Global Positioning System (GPS) Approach is a non-precision approach within IF but is not commonly used as functionality is currently limited. If however, pilots request this type of approach, Controllers **should**{.red} try to accommodate this when traffic permits.



### 6.9.2

When a pilot requests the GPS Approach, Controllers **must**{.red} check that the aircraft has an accceptable flight plan that provides lateral navigation to the intended arrival runway. Controllers can then expect aircraft to continue on their Flight Plan, and at an appropriate point (such as base), clear the aircraft for the GPS Approach. Vectors and/or altitude assingments **should not**{.red} be required and the pilot is expected to follow their flight plan to the runway threshold.
