# 5.2 On Guard Procedures

 

Tip

: When opening a frequency, Controllers **must**{.red} allow time for things to settle; for example, do not ‘on guard’ aircraft on short final, allow the aircraft to land and complete the rollout uninterrupted

 

### 5.2.1    

Controllers **must**{.red} always check what frequency the aircraft is tuned into before sending an on guard message in case they are with another tower/radar facility. In addition, if the airport elevation is deemed significant, Controllers may elect to take this into account (e.g. with an airport elevation of 5000ft, Controllers may adjust the ‘on guard’ altitude/FL by 5000ft/FL50 respectively). Below is a summary of when on guard procedures **must**{.red} be applied:
