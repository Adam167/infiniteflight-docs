### 7.4.2    

All training is considered optional with the exception of Radar Training – Controllers that wish to upgrade to Radar **must**{.red} have training, and meet the standards required *(see [7.4.4](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.4-radar-written-and-practical-tests#7.4.4) below)* **BEFORE** the Radar Practical Test.



### 7.4.3

A Recruiter will conduct a review on the performance of the Controller that has requested Radar Training, Supervisors may be polled if further details are required. The requirements laid out within this section *(see [7.4.1](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.4-radar-written-and-practical-tests#7.4.1) above)* will assist the Recruiter (and Supervisors if required) in gauging the Controller’s competency and suitability for the role. If the review is deemed successful, the Controller will be placed in the "Training Waitlist" ready for Trainer allocation. If the Controller is considered not to be ready, a set waiting period (minimum of 30 days) will be assigned where the Controller **must**{.red} endeavor to address the feedback given. Subsequent reviews will continue until there is no doubt that they are ready for the position.



### 7.4.4    

Following a successful review, a Trainer will assign themselves to the Recruits application and Radar Training will then commence (training for the position of Radar is mandatory). At an appropriate point during training, as decided by the Trainer; the Recruiter will issue the Radar Written Test and Radar Practical Test (and debrief as appropriate on the results - *see [7.1.1](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.1-overview#7.1.1) above*). The Radar Practical Test will only be organized once the Radar Written Test has been passed and the Trainer is satisfied that the Trainee is ready. Controlling on the Training Server is only permitted with the explicit permission of a Trainer - this will only be authorized if Trainees have met the requirements for upgrade to the rank of Officer *(see [1A.6.4](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.6-rank-structure#1a.6.4) above)*, and have **STARTED** their Radar Training with a Trainer.



### 7.4.5    

Whilst under Training, Trainees may wish to seek fellow Controllers to fly radar patterns on the IFATC Server for extra practice if the Trainer is not available. Provided the Trainee has the Trainer’s permission, the use of the Discord *#training-time* channel is authorized to try and find Controllers that are free.



### 7.4.6    

All aircraft present at the Radar Practical Test **must**{.red} fly in accordance with the radar service being provided; in addition, any aircraft type can be selected but it **must**{.red} be deemed suitable to meet the training objective. The following table lists the items that are included in the Radar Practical test:

 

| Test Element                   | Proficiency Required*                                        |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Terrain  Separation**{.red}  | Ensures that a minimum of 1000ft clearance is maintained with terrain at all times |
| **Aircraft  Separation**{.red} | Ensures that a minimum of 3nm separation laterally or 1000ft separation vertically is maintained at all times |
| Time  Management               | Consistently provides an expeditious approach to all aircraft under radar control, minimal vectoring to get aircraft in the correct area for an approach and combined commands (altitude and heading)  where appropriate |
| Approach Type                  | Able to deliver all types of service as outlined within this manual, and in particular, consistent timing and the correct technique (below the G/S) for the intercept heading of the ILS/GPS Approach |
| Go-Around                      | Correct use of missed-approach command and subsequent vectoring. Proactive monitoring and use of go-around if aircraft set up incorrectly for the type of approach they are flying |

**Automatic Failure: if proficiency is not met for elements marked in red, the test is automatically failed.**{.red} 

**The recruiter has the final say on the result of the test (see [7.1.1](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.1-overview#7.1.1) above)*

 

### 7.4.7
