# 1A.6  Region Assignment



### 1A.6.1

Following completion of the Specialist Check Ride phase *(see [7.4](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.4-promotion-to-specialist-(check-ride)) below)*, airport selection is governed by a region assignment program which allows Controllers to open any frequency (for which they qualify) in their assigned region. There are 10 global regions *(see 1A.6.1.1 below)* that Controllers may choose (regardless of physical location), and Controllers **must**{.red} control within the defined colored boundaries of their region following assignment.



Controllers are encouraged to explore new parts of the world and master the airports of their assigned region. They can, however, apply for a region transfer when eligible *(see [1A.6.3](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.6-region-assignment#1a.6.3) below)*.

### 1A.6.2

In the following cases, region assignments do not apply:



- Controllers that have not yet passed their Specialist Check Ride phase *(see [7.4](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.4-promotion-to-specialist-(check-ride)) below)*
- From 0600Z on Tuesday until 0600Z on Wednesday (this is considered a "free day" and Controllers may open **ANY** airport in the world)
- From 0600Z on Friday until 0600Z on Saturday for the official Friday Night Flight (FNF) event. Controllers **must**{.red} fully staff the event airports during this time **BEFORE** any other airport is opened. The only exception to this is when Controllers are not qualified to do so as per the rank structure *(see [1A.5.1](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.5-rank-structure#1a.5.1) above)*, in which case a sensible alternative can be selected
- Controllers that hold the rank of Supervisor or above *(see [1A.5.1](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.5-rank-structure#1a.5.1) above)*
- Any other occasion that is deemed appropriate by Staff and/or Moderators 



> Region assignment still applies to Controllers in the Officer Check Ride phase



## Region Transfers



### 1A.6.3

Apprentices may control anywhere in the world until their Specialist Check Ride phase is complete *(see [7.4](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.4-promotion-to-specialist-(check-ride)) below)* at which time they should submit a region request application for their first assignment. Subsequent region changes are only permitted after 30 calendar days in the previous region.



### 1A.6.4

To apply for a region change, the following procedure **must**{.red} be followed: 



Step 1

: Go to [website](https://if-atc.com) and login via the "Controller Discord Login" in the top right of your screen



Step 2

: A Discord authentication process will confirm that you are a member of IFATC, check it is the correct Discord account and then select "Authorize"



Step 3

: Select "My Profile" from the navigation bar at the top of the screen



Step 4

: Select the "Request Region Change" from the tab



Step 5

: Select the new region from the dropdown list, add any comments that you would like and then select "Request Change"



Tip

: You will not be able to submit a region change request until 30 calendar days has elapsed since your last request was approved



### 1A.6.5

Once submitted, Controllers will be able to see the status of their region request by going back to "Request Region Change" tab. Controllers **must not**{.red} control in the new region until they have received notification that the region change has been approved (this will be via a PM on the IFC).
