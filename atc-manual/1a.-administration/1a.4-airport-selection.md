# 1A.4 Airport Selection



### 1A.4.1

- The ATC Schedule posted on the [IFC](https://community.infiniteflight.com) will feature 3 - 5 daily airports to help focus traffic into a concentrated area of the world
- Controllers can control *anywhere in the world at any time (featured airports do not have to be fully staffed before a Controller is permitted to open an airport of their choosing) with the exception of official events

- Official event timings and rules will always be posted in *#readonly*, this includes the Friday Night Flight (FNF) event from 0600Z on Friday until 0600Z on Saturday. Controllers **must**{.red} fully staff the event airports during this time **BEFORE** any other airport is opened. The only exception to this is when Controllers are not qualified to do so as per the rank structure *(see [1A.6.1](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.6-rank-structure#1a.6.1) below)*, in which case a sensible alternative can be selected



**Note: Controllers that are currently in the "Specialist Check Ride" phase **must not**{.red} control any featured airport from the ATC Schedule or for official events unless indicated otherwise (see [7.4.2](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.4-promotion-to-specialist-(check-ride)#7.4.2) below)*



> For official events (e.g. FNF, FF, GA Day or steams), Controllers can open the event airports up to 1 hour (maximum) before the event start time to ensure full coverage
