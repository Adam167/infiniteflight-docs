# 1A.3 Controller Rules



## General

### 1A.3.1

- All Controllers **must**{.red} announce in *#controllers* when opening/closing any frequency on the Expert Server. When closing, a **MINIMUM** of 5 minutes warning and the last ATIS letter used **must**{.red} be provided
- Controllers are expected to show common courtesy to other Controllers by sharing where possible, opening frequencies that promote traffic between airports, and opening before announcing in *#controllers*
- Opening frequencies is on a first come, first serve basis within *#controllers*. Therefore Controllers **should not**{.red} reserve frequencies privately or not open in anticipation of a particular frequency becoming available. This does not apply to certain events where frequency allocation may be authorized
- Controllers **should**{.red} avoid staffing or providing service to airports which do not have ramp spawns points for aircraft
- Controllers that utilize the *@Tower Relief* and *@Radar Relief* reaction roles **must**{.red} only use this once, and **must**{.red} include the airport and time they are closing 
- Controllers **must not**{.red} control on the Training Server *(see [7.5.4](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.5-radar-theory-and-practical-tests#7.5.4) below for exceptions)*
- Controllers **must not**{.red} act as a Controller and as a pilot simultaneously on separate devices, violating Infinite Flight’s Terms & Agreement
- Standards of controlling are closely monitored – **Controllers are expected to control within their means,  prioritizing quality over quantity**{.red} *(see [1A.5](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.5-rank-structure#1a.5-rank-structure) below)*



## Airport Selection

### 1A.3.2

- The ATC Schedule posted on the [IFC](https://community.infiniteflight.com) will feature 3 - 5 daily airports to help focus traffic into a concentrated area of the world
- Controllers can control *anywhere in the world at any time (featured airports do not have to be fully staffed before a Controller is permitted to open an airport of their choosing) with the exception of official events

- Official event timings and rules will always be posted in *#readonly*, this includes the Friday Night Flight (FNF) event from 0600Z on Friday until 0600Z on Saturday. Controllers **must**{.red} fully staff the event airports during this time **BEFORE** any other airport is opened. The only exception to this is when Controllers are not qualified to do so as per the rank structure *(see [1A.5.1](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.5-rank-structure#1a.5.1) below)*, in which case a sensible alternative can be selected



**Note: Controllers that are currently in the "Specialist Check Ride" phase **must not**{.red} control any featured airport from the ATC Schedule or for official events unless indicated otherwise (see [7.4.2](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.4-promotion-to-specialist-(check-ride)#7.4.2) below)*



> For official events (e.g. FNF, FF, GA Day or steams), Controllers can open the event airports up to 1 hour (maximum) before the event start time to ensure full coverage 



## Violations

### 1A.3.3

All Controllers have the ability to issue a Level 2 or 3 Violation once they have been added to IFATC. Guidelines are contained within this manual *(see [1B.1](/guide/atc-manual/1b.-violations/1b.1-overview#1b.1-overview) below).*
