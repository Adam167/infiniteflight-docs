# 1A.3 Controller Rules



### 1A.3.1

- All Controllers **must**{.red} announce in *#controllers* when opening/closing any frequency on the Expert Server. When closing, a **MINIMUM** of 5 minutes warning and the last ATIS letter used **must**{.red} be provided. Use of abbreviations in place of the full facility names is acceptable *(see [1A.1.2](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.1-discord-communication#1a.1.2) above)*
- Controllers are expected to show common courtesy to other Controllers by sharing where possible, opening frequencies that promote traffic between airports, and opening before announcing in *#controllers*
- Opening frequencies is on a first come, first serve basis within *#controllers*. Therefore Controllers **should not**{.red} reserve frequencies privately or not open in anticipation of a particular frequency becoming available. This does not apply to certain events where frequency allocation may be authorized
- Controllers **should**{.red} avoid staffing or providing service to airports which do not have ramp spawns points for aircraft
- Controllers that utilize the *@Tower Relief* and *@Radar Relief* reaction roles **must**{.red} only use these once, and **must**{.red} include the airport and time they are closing
- Controllers that utilize the *@split* reaction role **must**{.red} only use it once, and **must**{.red} include the airport. It is recommended to use this prior to opening
- Controllers **must not**{.red} control on the Training Server *(see [7.4.4](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.4-radar-theory-and-practical-tests#7.4.4) below for exceptions)*
- Controllers **must not**{.red} act as a Controller and as a pilot simultaneously on separate devices, violating Infinite Flight’s Terms & Agreement
- Standards of controlling are closely monitored – **Controllers are expected to control within their means,  prioritizing quality over quantity**{.red} *(see [1A.6](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.6-rank-structure#1a.6-rank-structure) below)*



### 1A.3.2

All Controllers have the ability to issue a Level 2 or 3 Violation once they have been added to IFATC. Guidelines are contained within this manual *(see [1B.1](/guide/atc-manual/1b.-violations/1b.1-overview#1b.1-overview) below).*
