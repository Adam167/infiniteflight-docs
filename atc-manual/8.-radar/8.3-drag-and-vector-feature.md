# 8.3  Drag and Vector Feature

 

### 8.3.1    

The Drag and Vector Feature is one of the most fundamental tools at the disposal of radar controllers and **should** be utilised. When using this feature, there are 4 pieces of information that are displayed for the controller, these are:



\-    Heading

\-    Distance from aircraft’s current position

\-    The time it will take to reach that point (at the aircraft’s current speed)

\-    And the highest terrain at that particular point

 

These are shown left to right, top to bottom in the below image *(see 8.3.1.1 below).*

### 8.3.2    

In order to scan for the minimum safe altitude that an aircraft can fly at, it is essential to scan the projected path that you plan on vectoring an aircraft on to look for the highest terrain. As a minimum, the highest terrain spotted **must** then be rounded up to the next whole 1000ft, and then another 1000ft added to this to satisfy terrain separation rules *(see 8.2.1 above)*.



### 8.3.3

From the image *(see 8.3.1.1 above)* the highest spotted terrain that was seen during this scan from the current aircraft’s position to where the drag and vector feature is currently, was 11,300ft. By rounding this figure up to the next 1000ft and then adding another 1000ft onto this to satisfy the terrain separation rules, the lowest altitude this aircraft **must** be given in this area is 13,000ft.
