# 9.1  Overview

 

Tip

: It is the responsibility of the Candidate/Controller to ensure they meet the minimum requirements *(see 2.3.1 above)* **BEFORE** seeking training. Failure to do so may invalidate your training request and further progression may not be granted for a period of time

 

### 9.1.1    

The Recruitment Team (Recruiters) have two main responsibilities, these are to manage new entrants during the recruitment process to join IFATC and secondly, to invigilate all theory and practical tests, with the final say on the result of the test (i.e. pass/fail).



### 9.1.2    

The Training Team (Trainers) is here to educate and train individuals within their specific area of study as Air Traffic Controllers, ensuring test readiness and a high standard of controlling.



### 9.1.3    

For the purposes of this manual, the following definitions are provided:

 

| **Definition** | **Meaning**                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Candidate      | A potential IFATC Controller that is seeking training before taking or re-taking the Initial Practical Test |
| Controller     | A current IFATC Controller that is seeking training for their current position* or for the position of Officer (Radar Training) |

 

*Controller development is a key aspect within IFATC, Controllers can expect feedback during their time within the IFATC Team **and are expected to utilise this to improve.** 

 

### 9.1.4    

All aspects of controlling are trained but Candidates and Controllers **should**{red} be aware of areas they wish to target so that the time allocated can be utilised to the Controllers benefit. **The Trainer reserves the right to terminate training at any point if they deem that the trainee is not progressing or showing the dedication required.**{red} A training session can vary in length but typically last no longer than 1 hour. Trainees **must not** have more than 1 training session per day.
