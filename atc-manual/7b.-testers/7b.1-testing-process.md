# 7B.1 Testing Process



### 7B.1.1

All tests (regardless of position) are conducted by Recruiters and issued based on the given materials and/or scenarios provided in this section. Testing scenarios will vary from one recruit to the next. This is to ensure that Candidates/Controllers are better prepared for a wide array of situations found in the Expert Server environment. Care should be taken by the Recruiter(s) to avoid issuing the same testing scenario repeatedly. Testers must have the keyword “test time” added to their Slack notifications so that in the event a test is called, they will receive an alert. 



### 7B.1.2

It is the responsibility of all Recruiter(s), Trainer(s), and Tester(s) to maintain familiarity with this section and follow all procedures accordingly. All instructions provided by the Recruiter(s) **must**{.red} be followed in order to ensure a test is carried out in a fair manner. Any behavior not falling in line with the expectations of being a participant of the Testing Team are grounds for review and appropriate disciplinary measures as deemed by the IFATC Manager and/or the IFATC Moderator(s).



### 7B.1.3

The following table outlines the minimum notice period that **must**{.red} be given to a Candidate/Controller before their Initial or Radar Practical Test (including the test location):



| Test Type | Minimum Notice Period |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| Initial   | No minimum            |
| Radar     | 24 hours*             |

*The notice period may be reduced if the Recruiter and Candidate/Controller find a mutually acceptable time.
