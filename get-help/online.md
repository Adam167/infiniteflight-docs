# Online

This is where you will find help about your online experience in Infinite Flight. If you can't find the answer to your question below, please contact our support team at [support@infiniteflight.com](mailto:support@infiniteflight.com).



## Can I play Infinite Flight offline?

An internet connection is required at all times to play Infinite Flight.



For the time being, we have decided to stream our terrain & scenery imagery which uses very little data from our testing. In the future it is our desire and plan to support offline gameplay or even the ability to download scenery for “on the go” use. Our ultimate goal is to allow for a versatile experience which allows customers to enjoy Infinite Flight both on and offline. There is no set timeframe for accomplishing this.



## When I try to login, I receive "Error Code 1"?

This is something you can see when you have yet to create an account in Infinite Flight and are trying to sign in. As you purchase your first subscription, an account in Infinite Flight is created for you. You can then choose to link your account with a Infinite Flight Community profile which allows you to use your subscription on multiple devices, as well as securing your account in case you lose access to it for some reason.



If you try to sign in and are receiving Error Code 1, it means that you're trying to sign in to an account that does not exist in the applications database as of yet.




## I only see boxes and/or names of other pilots in the app, not their actual aircraft? 

This is most likely because the aircraft they are flying is not downloaded to your device. To fix this, go to Settings > Live and adjust the “Airplane count” to an appropriate amount.



> The higher you have the airplane count set to, the more performance demanding it will be for your device



Additionally, if you are using cellular you need to make sure to have the “Automatic airplane download on cellular” box checked!



## I'm receiving an error saying that my account is being used on another device?

This can happen if the connection between your device and our servers times out multiple times in a shorter time period. Usually it means the connection between you and us are unstable. This should resolve itself but if it becomes a recurring issue, further troubleshooting may be required.



It can also happen if you put Infinite Flight in the background to do other things on your device, as the app is then completely paused by the operating system which could lead to connectivity issues. It is strongly recommended not to put the app in the background when flying on any of our servers due to this reason. If this happens, there is unfortunately no way to recover the current flight and the app needs to be restarted.



## My connection to the weather server is red

This issue is usually only temporary and resolves itself on the hour. If it remains for a longer time period, turning on “flight mode” on your device for 30 seconds could resolve the issue. If it still remains red and could become a problem during your flight, please send an e-mail to [support@infiniteflight.com](mailto:support@infiniteflight.com) for further assistance.



## I'm unable to communicate with ATC

This is often a difficult issue to resolve, and usually is due to a poor connection. Placing your device into "flight mode" for 30 seconds can help re-establish a connection to our Live servers.



> If this does not fix the issue, we recommend diverting to another airport that is uncontrolled to avoid interference with other online traffic
