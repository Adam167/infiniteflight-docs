# This is where you will find help about your online experience in Infinite Flight
If you can't find the answer to your question below, please contact our support team at support@infiniteflight.com 


## Can i play Infinite Flight offline? 
An internet connection is required at all times to play Infinite Flight.

For the time being, we have decided to stream our terrain & scenery imagery which uses very little data from our testing. In the future it is our desire and plan to support offline gameplay or even the ability to download scenery for “on the go” use. Our ultimate goal is to allow for a versatile experience which allows customers to enjoy Infinite Flight both on and offline. There is not set timeframe for accomplishing this.

## When i try to login, i receive an error saying that this account has never been used with Infinite Flight? 
This is something you can see when you have yet to create an account in Infinite Flight. An account is created when you purchase a PRO subscription and can’t be created before that. You then have the option to link your account to either a Google profile. You are most likely trying to sign in with credentials that have yet to be linked to an account in Infinite Flight yet. 

## I only see boxes and/or names of other pilots in the app, not their actual aircraft? 
This is most likely because the aircraft they are flying, is not downloaded to your device.
Go to Settings in the app, then select the “Live” tab & adjust the “Airplane count” to an appropriate amount.

**Important:** The higher you have the airplane count set to, the more performance demanding it will be for your device.

Additionally, if you are using cellular you need to make sure to have the “Automatic airplane download on cellular” box checked!

## I'm receiving an error saying that my account is being used on another device?
This can happen if the connection between your device and our servers times out multiple times in a shorter time period.

Usually it means the connection between you and us are unstable. Most of the times it resolves itself. But if it becomes a more recurring issue, further troubleshooting might be required.

This can also happen if you put Infinite Flight in the background to do other things on your device, as the app is then completely paused by the operating which could lead to connectivity issues. It is strongly recommended not to put the app in the background when flying on any of our servers due to this reason.

If this happens, there is unfortunately no way to recover the current flight and the app needs to be restarted.
