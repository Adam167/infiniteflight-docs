## Minimum Device Requirements

Below are the minimum requirements for a successful install on your device. In addition to this, we strongly recommend that your device has **at least** 3GB+ of internal device memory (RAM):



+++ Android

 -    Android 9.0 (Pie) operating system or later with a 64-bit processor

 -    Device must support OpenGL ES 3.0, [click here to check](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=littledreamstudios.openglcheck&hl=en)



> Due to the large variety of Android devices, there is not a full list of devices supported although the vast majority can be found [here](https://community.infiniteflight.com/t/device-compatibility-thread-20-3-built-by-us-for-you/323610). Customers with devices that are not supported at this time will receive a message on the Google Play Store when attempting to download the latest update for Infinite Flight to advise that the device in use is not supported



Tip

: If your device doesn’t have a 64-bit processor and cannot be upgraded to Android 9.0, you will be able to enjoy Infinite Flight on versions prior to 23.2 for a short period of time. To find out if your device meets these requirements, check [here](https://community.infiniteflight.com/t/21-1-android-support/560936)

+++



+++ iOS

 - iOS 15 operating system or later with a 64-bit processor

Tip

: Any device that supports iOS 13 should be able to update to iOS 15, however, if your device doesn’t have iOS 13 operating system or later, you will still be able to enjoy Infinite Flight on versions prior to 21.6.

## Will I have to repurchase IAPs (in-app purchases) every time I redownload Infinite Flight?

All App Stores selling Infinite Flight and its associated in-app purchases allow for downloading without repurchasing after an item has been paid for.

If you’re an Android user your previous purchases will automatically be unlocked when you download the app. iOS users must open the aircraft selection page, then tap “Restore Purchases” to access any previously purchased regions and aircraft.



To ensure success, please check the following:



- You have used the same App Store account and ID as the original purchase

- You have not been previously refunded

- You are not using any IAP hacking programs

  

> If none of the above are applicable, uninstalling and then reinstalling the app often resolves the issue



## I want a refund. How should I proceed?

If you are experiencing difficulty with Infinite Flight, please allow us the opportunity to help resolve your issue first by contacting us at [support@infiniteflight.com](mailto:support@infiniteflight.com).

If you still wish to receive a refund, the following processes are followed depending on which App Store was used:



+++ Android

Google Play Store offers a two hour grace period to request a full refund for any purchase. Following the two hour grace period all refunds need to be requested with the developer by providing a complete copy of the receipt which shows the purchase ID beginning with “GPA”. **Refunds are not guaranteed and will be reviewed on a case by case basis**

+++



+++ iOS

iTunes policy is that all app sales are final. We are not able to provide refunds, but you may be able to receive a refund by emailing iTunes customer service with your request

+++



## Can I recover my purchases if I switch from Apple to Android or vice versa?

Unfortunately purchases made through the App Store or Google Play Store do not transfer to the opposing App Store, whether Apple or Android. Each App Store has control over their own purchases, not allowing them to be honored by the opposite store.



## Will new updates be available on the Amazon App Store?

Unfortunately new updates will not be released for Amazon devices. We will gauge Amazon demand at a later date to determine whether or not we will continue to support the Amazon App Store updates. The version prior to *Global* will remain available at this time.



## How can I join the Beta Team?

We do not accept direct requests to be an Alpha or Beta Tester. Keep an eye out here on the [Community Forum](https://community.infiniteflight.com) for future openings!



## OIS not available seen on 350 cockpit screen

The OIS is an extremely complicated screen to reproduce. Some screens may be added in a future release.



## How do I switch cockpits for the Cessna 172?

The cockpit of the C172 can be changed by selecting a different livery. The table below shows which panels are with each livery:

| Livery              | Panel       |
| :------------------ | :---------- |
| Civil Air Patrol    | Steam Gauge |
| Default             | Steam Gauge |
| Embry Riddle        | G1000       |
| F-HATZ              | G1000       |
| N1322K              | G1000       |
| N456DX              | G1000       |
| Near North Aviation | Steam Gauge |
| Yellow Blue         | Steam Gauge |



## I just fell down through the ground or got stuck in a "pothole"

This usually happens when the scenery stream from our servers to your device becomes corrupt. To resolve this issue, please try the following steps:



Step 1

: Re-launch Infinite Flight (make sure you stop it from running in the background first)



Step 2

: Before starting a new flight, go to Settings > General and then tap “Clear scenery cache”



Step 3

: Start a flight (try on Solo first)



> In some rare cases, the steps above might not be enough. In that case, please reinstall the app



## I can't hear any ATC voices on my device

If you are experiencing issues related to voices, please follow the steps below:



+++ Android

Step 1

: Go to Settings > Accessibility > Text to speech output > Install voice data



Step 2

: Remove all voices that are possible to remove, then download & install them again (specifically the English options)



> Depending on the Android version, your TTS settings could be placed a bit differently. If you can’t find them using the steps above, try Settings > General Management > Language input > Text to speech > Cogwheel next to your preferred TTS engine

+++



+++ iOS

Step 1

: Go to Settings > Accessibility > Voice Over > Speech > Voice



Step 2

: Once here you will see tables for voices broken down by English (e.g. US, Australia, India, Ireland etc.)



Step 3

: Download the voices by clicking on the cloud icon with the arrow that points downward found on the right of the voice name



Tip

: You have to click on each voice and then tap on the cloud icon to download



Step 4

: After you have the voices installed on your device, restart your device & then launch Infinite Flight. You should now see the list of selectable voices under your Live Settings for both Pilot and ATC

## I can't connect to ForeFlight or another third-party app



If you are having issues connecting to a third-party app such as ForeFlight, the following steps can help:



Step 1

: Ensure you are connected on the same WiFi network as the device running the third-party app



Step 2

: Ensure "Infinite Flight Connect" and "ForeFlight Link" are both enabled in Settings > General



Step 3

: Check you have permission to communicate with other devices on the local network. This varies on Android, but on iOS, a popup will appear that you must select "OK" to (if you selected no, you can go to iOS Settings > Infinite Flight and tick "Local Network")

## Google Play says my device is not compatible anymore

This alert will show if your device does not support the latest update of Infinite Flight, or if your device is not Google Play Protect certified. The following steps will help you determine this:



Step 1

 : Ensure your device meets the [minimum device requirements](/guide/get-help/general#minimum-device-requirements). If it doesn't, then you will not be able to update Infinite Flight to the latest version



Step 2

 : Check to see if your device is Google Play Protect certified. You can do this by opening the Google Play Store, tap on Main Menu > Settings and check "Play Protect certification" under "About" (it should say "Device is certified")



If your device is not certified, this is because Google cannot validate the security or compatibility status of your device. To resolve this, ensure that:



 - Your device's bootloader is *locked*

 - Your device has the latest official software update from your manufacturer

 - Your device is on the list of [Google Play's support devices](https://storage.googleapis.com/play_public/supported_devices.html)



You can read more on the [Google Support website](https://support.google.com/android/answer/10248227?hl=en-GB#zippy=%2Cdevice-isnt-certified).
