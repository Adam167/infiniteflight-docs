It is currently available in select markets and for select aircraft for users without a Pro subscription.

Aircraft Rental Passes are available on select aircraft, and this selection will change over time.

To confirm if your chosen aircraft can be rented, a RENT AIRCRAFT button will show in the bottom of the Aircraft Selection Page.

Step 2

## Unable to purchase a Pro subscription

If you find that you are unable to purchase an Aircraft Rental Pass while following the steps above, it is likely due to one of the following reasons:


- Rentals are not currently available in your region
- The selected aircraft is not available for rent.
- Parental permissions are enabled which are preventing in-app purchases
- There is a problem with your network connection
- You do not have the most recent version of Infinite Flight installed

To try to fix the issue we recommend checking parental permissions, restarting your device, and then ensuring you have a good network connection before trying again.
