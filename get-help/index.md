We’re aware of an increased crash rate on all platforms since the 20.1 update. These crashes are mostly related to the airspaces feature on the map. Some may see an improvement by tapping the cogwheel on the map, followed by "Hide all airspaces".

Our developers are working very hard to get these issues resolved as soon as possible.

We’re sorry about the inconvenience this causes.
