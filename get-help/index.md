**iOS 14.2 Beta**

Users that have downloaded the iOS 14.2 Beta may experience issues with Infinite Flight at this time. We’re currently monitoring the situation but are not planning on any fix for this at this time, since 14.2 is still a very early Beta. If the issue remains once we gets closer to 14.2, we’ll make sure it will be fixed before it’s publicly released.
