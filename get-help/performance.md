# Performance



## General Tips

- We recommend that the "frame rate limit" is set to **30fps** for most devices. Some high-performance devices can use **60fps**, but it requires more of the device in terms of performance and power consumption

  > If you start noticing performance degradations while using 60fps, it's strongly recommended that you lower it to 30fps

- Infinite Flight does not take up a specific amount of storage, it can change depending on things such as the area you’re flying in or how many aircraft that need to be downloaded. We therefore recommend that you always have at least **3GB** of storage available on your device

- Before longer flights, it is advised to reboot your device and close any apps running in the background to enhance your experience

- It is possible to fly and charge the device at the same time. The key to this is to use less power than being charged. One way to accomplish this is lower your screen brightness and ensure low power mode is enabled in-app

- Disable active ad or message blocking apps

- Don’t modify, “Root”, or “Jailbreak” your device

- Use a strong WiFi network within a relatively close proximity to your device

- Lower Infinite Flight graphics and performance settings in the order listed: 

  - Lower the Rendering Resolution setting

  - Disable Anti-Aliasing

  - Lower the Rendering Quality setting

  - Lower the Texture Quality setting

  - Lower Airplane count

  - Lower 3D Object Density



+++ Additional Android tips

- Make sure you have Android Battery Saver disabled. Having this enabled can cause a lot of degradation in terms of both storage, performance and network
- Newer Android devices may work fine with Anti-Aliasing on. Turning this off can help performance for older/less powerful Android models
- Some devices (i.e. Samsung) may have a Game Tuner app to enhance the performance of games. While some users have not seen an issue there is a number who have. It is best to run Infinite Flight by itself instead of through a game tuner

+++ Additional iOS tips

- Perform a restart. This is a quick and reliable way of making sure your device is operating at peak efficiency. 

  - For iOS devices without a home button, this is done by holding down the power/lock button and the volume up button at the same time until you see "slide to power off," then slide that to power off the device. Wait 30 seconds, then hold down the power/lock button until you’ve returned to the home screen.

- Make sure “Low power mode” if "off" (it is indicated as "on" when the battery icon is yellow). This can be deactivated from Settings > Battery, or from “Control Center”. Having “Low power mode” enabled while using Infinite Flight could result in a performance degradation

  > This is not the same as “Low power mode” in Infinite Flight. This is a device function

> If none of the above helps, and as a last resort, consider resetting your device to factory settings. Make sure to back up all important data before doing so as this could be lost
