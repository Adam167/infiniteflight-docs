If you’re about to fly online, we also use a variety of colors to give you an idea of what the weather is like:

| Indication                                      | Meaning                      |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-vfr.png)   | Visual Flight Rules          |
| ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-mvfr.png) | Marginal Visual Flight Rules |
| ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-ifr.png)   | Instrument Flight Rules      |



Runway color codes help you know where the wind is coming from and which runways are ‘most likely’ in use. But watch out, sometimes controllers will be using a different runway than you’re expecting, make sure to look out for traffic! Check out the table below:

| Indication                                                 | Meaning                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-green.png)   | Headwind above 3kts (or wind from any direction when under 3kts) - runway recommended |
| ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-orange.png) | Crosswind above 3kts                                         |
| ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-red.png)       | Tailwind above 3kts - runway not recommended                 |


## Server

The various live servers available to use are displayed here. Each server has its own set of rules and minimum grade requirements, make sure to check these before trying to join! Tap on the one you want to fly in and then tap the ‘back’ button.

**In addition to the minimum grade requirement, the number of total Level 1 Violations must be at least 50% less than the number of total landings. Pilots may not have [5 or more Level 2 or 3 Violations in the last 365 days](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/violations#what-happens-if-i-get-a-violation%3F)*
