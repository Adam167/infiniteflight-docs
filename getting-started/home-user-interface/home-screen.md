# Home Screen

Welcome to the home screen of your newly downloaded Infinite Flight app. Below you’ll find everything you need to know about this page and how to navigate your way through it.

1. In the top right hand corner you’ll find your username, [tap it to see your profile](/guide/getting-started/home-user-interface/user-profile#user-profile).

   

2. Solo mode is offline (no internet connection required), allowing you to practice without anyone else around, in weather conditions of your choosing. [See "Fly Solo"](/guide/getting-started/home-user-interface/fly-solo#fly-solo).

   

3. Our three live servers allow you to choose the experience you want, but with some company too. [See "Fly Online"](/guide/getting-started/home-user-interface/fly-online#fly-online).

   

4. Don’t want to fly? Here you can control aircraft instead on our live servers! [See "Air Traffic Control"](/guide/getting-started/home-user-interface/air-traffic-control#air-traffic-control).

   

5. All controlling and flights you do are recorded, and stored here when you want to look back. Want more info? [See "Replays"](/guide/getting-started/home-user-interface/replays#replays).

   

6. As well as replays, all information is automatically logged when you fly or control so that you can keep track [in the Logbook](/guide/getting-started/home-user-interface/logbook#logbook)! 

   

7. Our default settings are sure to get you going, but if you want to, you can customize your experience [here](/guide/getting-started/home-user-interface/settings#settings).

   

8. Rookie or professional, our [User Guide](/guide) is here to help any experience level.

   

9. Subscribe to our social media pages and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/infiniteflightapp) to see the latest.
