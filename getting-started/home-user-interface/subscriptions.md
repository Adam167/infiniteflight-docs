## How to Manage your Subscription

If you decide to install Infinite Flight on a different device, your subscription can be passed over provided you are using the same Apple ID (for iOS) or Google Play account (for Android) that the previous subscription was purchased on.



If however, you are no longer using the same platform (i.e. iOS to Android or vice versa), or using a different Apple ID/Google Play account, then you will need to link your Community Forum Account first for it to be recognised. To do this, follow the steps below:



Step 1

: If no active subscription is detected, the "Get Pro" button will be displayed in the top right hand corner of the [Home Screen](/guide/getting-started/home-user-interface/home-screen#home-screen), tap it



Step 2

: The [account page](/guide/getting-started/home-user-interface/settings#account) will be displayed, from there, tap the "Get Pro" button next to "Your Infinite Flight Pro Subscription"



Step 3

: Tap "I already have an account" in the bottom left hand corner of the screen



Step 4

: Tap "Sign In with Infinite Flight" and login to your existing Community Forum Account



## How to Revert to Default Account 

When Infinite Flight is launched on your device, it will search for an active subscription and automatically link to it if found. If however, you want to use your account on a different device, you can use the "Switch Account" button within the [Account Settings page](/guide/getting-started/home-user-interface/settings#account).



Once you have finished using the device, you can "revert to default account" by following the steps below to make sure that your account is no longer in use:



Step 1

: The User Profile will be displayed in the top right hand corner of the [Home Screen](/guide/getting-started/home-user-interface/home-screen#home-screen), tap it



Step 2

: The [account page](/guide/getting-started/home-user-interface/settings#account) will be displayed, from there, tap the "Switch Account" button



Step 3

: The login page will be displayed, in the bottom right hand corner is the "Revert to Default Account" button, tap it
