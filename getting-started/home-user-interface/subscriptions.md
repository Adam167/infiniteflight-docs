## What is a Pro Subscription?

The Infinite Flight Pro Subscription comes with all In-App Purchases unlocked, including any newly added content during the active subscription period. Only items purchased separately will remain available once your subscription expires or is cancelled.



| Duration  | Price (USD) |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 1 Month   | $9.99       |
| 6 Months  | $49.99      |
| 12 Months | $79.99      |



*Android: Google Play Store customers can now purchase a subscription with a redeem card and store account balances. The subscriptions will automatically renew but can be cancelled from your PlayStore account at the Infinite Flight app page.*

If however, you are no longer using the same platform (i.e. iOS to Android or vice versa), or using a different Apple ID/Google Play account, then you will need to link your Community Forum Account first for it to be recognised. To do this, follow the steps below:

Step 2

: The [account page](/guide/getting-started/home-user-interface/settings#account) will be displayed, from there, tap the "Get Pro" button next to "Your Infinite Flight Pro Subscription"



Step 3
