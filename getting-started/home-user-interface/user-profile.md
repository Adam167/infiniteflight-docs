# User Profile



## Linking Community Forum Account

[Callsigns](/guide/getting-started/home-user-interface/user-profile#callsigns) are used whilst flying to identify you and for the Air Traffic Controllers to communicate with you, in addition to this, a unique identifier is shown by default. If however, you have an [Infinite Flight Community](https://community.infiniteflight.com) (IFC) account, you can choose to have your username displayed instead of the unique identifier. To do this, follow the steps below to link your account:



![Account Settings Page](_images/manual/frames/account.jpg)



Step 1

: Next to Community Forum Account, tap "Connect" button



Step 2

: A pop up will appear to confirm that you are happy for your information to be shared between the *Infinite Flight* app, and the *infiniteflight.com* website. Tap "Continue"



Step 3

: A *community.infiniteflight.com* pop up will appear that will allow you to either login or create a new account (if you are already logged in on that device, it will automatically register this and you will only need to tap "authorize")



Step 4

: Once completed, it will return to the app and you will see that your IFC username is now displayed in the orange box



Tip

: Don't want your IFC username to show in-flight? No problem! You can still link your account if you want to, then visit [Settings > Live](/guide/getting-started/home-user-interface/settings#live) where you can un-tick the "Show Username In-Flight" box!



## Virtual Organization Affiliation

Your Virtual Organization affiliation can be found displayed in app next to your Username and within the "info tab" (tap on any aircraft from your map or mini map and then select the respective callsign/username to show the "info tab").



To add your VO affiliation, follow the steps below:



Tip

: Your Community Forum account must be linked for the VO affiliation to show in app, follow the [steps above](/guide/getting-started/home-user-interface/user-profile#linking-community-forum-account) to do this!



Step 1

: Visit the [Infinite Flight Community](https://community.infiniteflight.com) website and login



Step 2

: Tap your profile picture in the top right hand corner, a drop down box will appear. Tap the settings wheel that is in the top right hand corner of the drop down box



Step 3

: Select "Preferences"



Step 4

: A new page will appear, on the left hand side of the screen will be a navigation bar, select "Profile"



Step 5

: Scroll down the page to "Virtual Organization" and select the VO that you are affiliated with from the drop-down box

: Scroll to the bottom of the page and tap "Save Changes"



## The Grade Table

The Grade Table is broken up into 4 sections, these are:



- General Pilot Stats
- Level 1 Violations
- Level 2 Violations
- Level 3 Violations



![Grade Table](_images/manual/frames/grade-table.jpg)



1. The first column lists the parameters that determine your grade, these are listed in the table below.

   

2. This column (displayed in white) shows what you have currently logged/received as a pilot.

   

3. The final column shows the requirements that you need to meet in order to progress to the next grade:

   - green parameters mean you have met the requirements for the next grade
   - orange parameters mean that you are yet to meet the requirement, this may be due to a deficiency, or if you have exceeded the limitation

   

4. The 'Show Violation History' tab will open a log which shows all violations, why they were received and if issued by a Controller, their name. This can then be used when wanting to [appeal a Level 2 or Level 3 Violation](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/violations#appealing-a-level-2-or-3-violation) if you believe it was issued in error.



Below is a table that outlines the different Grade requirements:

| Requirement                                    | G1   | G2   | G3     | G4     | G5      |

| Min Flight Time (90 days)                      | -    | 3    | 10     | 30     | 70      |
| Min Landings (90 days)                         | -    | 5    | 15     | 100    | 180     |
| Max Level 1 Violations (24 hours)              | -    | 7    | 5      | 0      | 0       |
| Max Level 1 Violations (7 days)                | -    | 25   | 5      | 0      | 0       |
| Max Level 1 Violations/Landings Ratio (1 year) | -    | 0.8  | 0.5    | 0.22   | 0.05    |
| Max Level 2 Violations (1 year)                | -    | 10   | 5      | 4      | 2       |
| Max Level 3 Violations (7 days)                | -    | 5    | 0      | 0      | 0       |
| Max Level 3 Violations (1 year)                | -    | 10   | 5      | 4      | 2       |
| Max Combined Level 2 and 3 Violations (1 year) | -    | 10   | 5      | 4      | 2       |
{.grade-table}



Below is a table that outlines all the Grade Table parameters and a brief description of them:

| Parameter                              | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| XP                                     | This number is calculated through landings and flight time. This does not represent skill |
| Total Flight Time                      | This is the total flight time you have accumulated represented in hours (hrs) and minutes (mn) |
| Total Landings                         | This is the total number of recorded landings that you have  |
| Flight Time (90 days)                  | Number of hours accumulated in the last 90 days              |
| Landings (90 days)                     | Number of landings recorded in the last 90 days              |
| Level 1 Violations (24 hours)          | Total number of Level 1 Violations accumulated in the last 24 hours |
| Level 1 Violations (7 days)            | Total number of Level 1 Violations accumulated in the last 7 days |
| Level 1 Violations/Landing (12 months) | Your total amount of Level 1 Violations is divided by your Landings (in the last 12 months) to determine a Violation to Landing ratio*. |
| Level 2 Violations (1 year)            | Total number of Level 2 Violations accumulated in the last 1 year |
| Level 3 Violations (7 days)            | Total number of Level 3 Violations in the last 7 days        |
| Level 3 Violations (1 year)            | Total number of Level 3 Violations accumulated in the last 1 year |
| All Violations (1 year)                | Total number of Level 2 and Level 3 Violations in the last 1 year |



*Examples of Violation to Landing Ratios:

- 10 Level 1 Violations (total) and 20 Landings (12 months) would give a ratio of **0.50**
- 10 Level 1 Violations (total) and 10 Landings (12 months) would give a ratio of **1.00**
- 20 Level 1 Violations (total) and 10 Landings (12 months) would give a ratio of **1.50**



## Callsigns

Callsigns are used whilst flying to identify you and for the Air Traffic Controllers to communicate with you, follow the steps below to find out how to change your callsign: 



Step 1

: From the home screen, tap your user profile in the top right hand corner of your device



Step 2

: The "Account" tab should automatically display, but it can be selected from the navigation bar on the left of your device if it hasn't



Step 3

: Tap the edit "pencil" symbol to the right of your device in line with "Callsign"



Step 4

: Using the navigation bar on the left of the screen, you can either select the "Airlines" or "General Aviation" tabs



Step 5

: There are three columns displayed that can be used to customize your callsign. If you selected the "Airlines" tab, then you can scroll through the first column to select the airline you wish to use. The second column can be tapped to enter an alphanumeric identifier, tap "OK" when you are happy with your selection. Finally, a "Suffix" can be added by tapping the desired one, you can select "None" if you do not wish to use one



Tip

: Want a more realistic experience? Try to match your aircraft livery with the callsign you are using! As well as this, make sure to only add the "Heavy" suffix when you have a gross take-off weight of more than 300,000lb (136,000kg) and the "Super" suffix when operating the A380



Step 6

: If you selected the "General Aviation" tab, the same process as above applies however instead of the airline callsign, the "Country Code" is used instead



Tip

: The country code applies to where the aircraft is registered - therefore it does not need to be the same as the country you are flying from/to!



## How to Format General Aviation Callsigns

Key:

- "AB" means any two letter combination, "ABC" means any three letter combination, and so on
- "12" means any two number combination, "123" means any three number combination, and so on



The table below shows the formatting that must be used when selecting an ID for a General Aviation callsign:
