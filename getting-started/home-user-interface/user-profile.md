# User Profile

Your User Profile is a way of keeping track whilst you’re flying or controlling the skies of Infinite Flight. Below is everything you need to know about what it records!

![User Profile Page](_images/manual/frames/user-profile.jpg)

 

1. Your Display Name can be changed here and is shown on a display tag when you’re online. To help users identify you, we recommend using a similar Display Name to your Infinite Flight Community Username. Not a member of the IFC yet? [Join here!](https://community.infiniteflight.com/)

   

2. Your Callsign can be changed here and is what you’ll be called by Air Traffic Controllers that are communicating with you. You can choose between Airline callsigns or your own General Aviation callsigns, and you can add various Suffixes to these too.

   

3.  XP is displayed here and is automatically updated as your flight progresses. Stats that contribute to this are flight time, the number of landings (taking into account g-force), the wind & turbulence during the landing, and any violations received.

   

4. Flight Time is displayed here from all flights that are completed online.  

   


5. Your Infinite Flight Grade is displayed here. Grades are determined from your total stats, your behavior whilst online, and your activity.  Tap the information link next to your Grade to display your Grade Table.

   

6. Your total number of online flights is shown here.

   

7.  Your total number of online landings is shown here.

   

Tip

: Don't forget to hit 'exit flight' when you're done, otherwise data might not get recorded! 



## The Grade Table

The Grade Table is broken up into 4 sections, these are:



- General Pilot Stats
- Level 1 Violations
- Level 2 Violations
- Level 3 Violations



![Grade Table](_images/manual/frames/grade-table.jpg)



1. The first column lists the parameters that determine you grade, these are listed in the table below

   

2. This column (displayed in white) shows what you have currently logged/received as a pilot

   

3. The final column shows the requirements that you need to meet in order to progress to the next grade:

   - green parameters mean you have met the requirements for the next grade
   - orange parameters mean that you are yet to meet the requirement, this may be due to a deficiency, or if you have exceeded the limitation

   

4. The 'Show Violation History' tab will open a log which shows all violations, why they were received and if issued by a Controller, their name. This can then be used when wanting to [appeal a Level 2 or Level 3 Violation](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/violations#appealing-a-level-2-or-3-violation) if you believe it was issued in error.



Below is a table that outlines the different Grade requirements:

Below is a table that outlines all the Grade Table parameters and a brief description of them:

| Parameter                              | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| XP                                     | This number is calculated through landings and flight time. This does not represent skill |
| Total Flight Time                      | This is the total flight time you have accumulated represented in hours (hrs) and minutes (mn) |
| Total Landings                         | This is the total number of recorded landings that you have  |
| Flight Time (90 days)                  | Number of hours accumulated in the last 90 days              |
| Landings (90 days)                     | Number of landings recorded in the last 90 days              |
| Level 1 Violations (24 hours)          | Total number of Level 1 Violations accumulated in the last 24 hours |
| Level 1 Violations (7 days)            | Total number of Level 1 Violations accumulated in the last 7 days |
| Level 1 Violations/Landing (12 months) | Your total amount of Level 1 Violations is divided by your Landings (in the last 12 months) to determine a *Violation to Landing ratio. |
| Level 2 Violations (1 year)            | Total number of Level 2 Violations accumulated in the last 1 year |
| Level 3 Violations (7 days)            | Total number of Level 3 Violations in the last 7 days        |
| Level 3 Violations (1 year)            | Total number of Level 3 Violations accumulated in the last 1 year |
| All Violations (1 year)                | Total number of Level 2 and Level 3 Violations in the last 1 year |



*Examples of Violation to Landing Ratios:

- 10 Level 1 Violations (total) and 20 Landings (12 months) would give a ratio of **0.50**
- 10 Level 1 Violations (total) and 10 Landings (12 months) would give a ratio of **1.00**
- 20 Level 1 Violations (total) and 10 Landings (12 months) would give a ratio of **1.50**
