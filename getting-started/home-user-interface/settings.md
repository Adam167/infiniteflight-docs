# Settings

The Settings menu allows you to customize your Infinite Flight experience before and during play. Below is a guide to help you navigate your way around and to find the best settings for you!


![Settings Page](_images/manual/frames/settings-main1.jpg)


1. On the left hand side of the screen are 5 categories that split the settings up, tap each one to find settings within

   

2. Each setting is labelled and has a brief explanation beneath it

   

3. On the right hand side of the screen you can select that setting by tapping the box which will insert a tick to indicate it has now been set

   

4. Some settings have a label instead of a box, by tapping the label it will give you the option to change this to another setting (again, once set a tick is shown)

   

5. The Back button will take you back to the [Home Screen](/guide/getting-started/home-screen/home-screen#home-screen)

   

6. The About button allows you to access Infinite Flight Social Media, [Terms of Use](/legal/terms#terms-of-use-agreement-(tou)) and [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy#privacy-policy---infinite-flight-app)

## Audio

There are two sliders that adjust the SFX and ATC Volume. Slide your finger along the slider to find the desired setting.



![Audio Settings Page](_images/manual/frames/settings-audio1.jpg)



| Setting                                 | What it does                                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SFX Volume (Sound Effects Volume)       | This volume will adjust aircraft and environmental sounds (engines, flaps, interior, exterior, wind, city etc) |
| ATC Volume (Air Traffic Control Volume) | This volume will adjust how loud/quiet the Air Traffic Controllers are when speaking |



Tip

: For both of these settings, try to find a happy medium where you can enjoy the sounds of the aircraft whilst being able to hear Controllers and not miss a radio call. In addition, you will also be able to use your device volume to adjust the overall volume



## Graphics

Infinite Flight supports both iOS and Android device; because of this, the graphics settings may require attention to ensure you find the settings that work best for you and your device. Unfortunately, not all devices are able to perform with all settings on high. Different combinations of high, medium and/or low may be required.



![Graphics Settings Page](_images/manual/frames/settings-graphics1.jpg)



| Setting              | What it does                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Rendering Quality    | Controls the quality of the rendering                        |
| Rendering Resolution | Controls the rendering resolution of the aircraft and scenery |
| Texture Quality      | Controls the quality of the textures                         |
| Anti-Aliasing        | Makes lines/graphics smoother and softens out the jagged/rough graphics that you may experience (it is not supported on all devices and can run very slow because of this - if device performance starts to degrade, turn this setting to **OFF**) |
| Limit Frame Rate     | Limit Frame Rate to optimize battery life, when toggled to **ON** the rate is capped at 30 frames per second; when toggled to **OFF**, frame rates are much higher and will also reduce device performance (we recommend using this function for medium/long haul flying) |



## Controls

 In the control settings you can further adjust your control sensitivity for each axis. The 2 axes that your device’s accelerometers utilize are:



| Setting  | What it does                                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Roll     | Roll is the movement around the longitudinal axis (the longitudinal axis runs from the nose to the tail). This is left/right (banking) motion which is accomplished through the use of the ailerons found on the wings |
| Pitch    | Pitch is the movement around the lateral axis (the lateral axis runs from one wing tip to the other). This is the nose up/down motion through the use of the elevator as found on the tail |
| Yaw*     | Yaw is the rotation around the vertical axis. This motion is translated into the form of turning the nose left or right through the rudder on the tail |
| Throttle | Throttle is your power levers that you will use to adjust the amount of thrust provided by the engines |



**Yaw is the third axis; however, it is not controlled via an accelerometer. You control Yaw through the use of the [Rud Brakes](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) slider as found on the bottom right corner when you spawn*




![Control Settings Page](_images/manual/frames/settings-controls1.jpg)



Tip

: In the screenshot above products such as the Logitech 3D Pro Joystick are not being used, therefore Yaw and Throttle “Key/Axis” assignments are unassigned. These controls will be seen on screen as soon as you spawn



1. Axes (current screen) and Commands are found at the top of this page. Tapping on "commands" will take you to the list of available commands that you could program to your yoke, joystick, keyboard or other controlling device. Simply tap on the item’s “Key/Item”, push the button on your joystick and you’ve now assigned a new command to that button

   

2. These are your sensitivity controls for the 3 axes as mentioned above. Low sensitivity is on the left while High sensitivity is on the right. Try flying around for a little bit before adjusting these. If you inadvertently adjust these and need to set it back to default settings, tap on the "Restore Defaults" button

   

3. The "Restore Defaults" button will reset your control settings to factory option. If you’re having trouble with sensitivities or any other control issues, we recommend you use this. The "Show Devices" button will show the devices (if any) that it is using for your controls. Without any external joysticks or yokes, clicking this button will show 1 device. The "Setup Tutorial" button will redirect you to a tutorial on the Infinite Flight Community forum. This will guide you how to set up joysticks, yokes or any other external devices



## ForeFlight

"ForeFlight Link" allows Infinite Flight pilots to use ForeFlight and it’s many features as if they were in a real airplane. Practice approaches and procedures, and fly a route before spending that hard-earned money on fuel! You’ll have maps, approach plates, weather, performance data, traffic and synthetic vision right from your mobile device. With ForeFlight’s new connection method, we’ve put together this video to show you how to get started!
