# Violations

​               

## What are Violations?

 

Violations can either be automatically generated (Level 1) or issued by ATC (Level 2 or 3) and are a way to moderate pilot behavior on the [Training and Expert Servers](/guide/getting-started/home-screen/fly-online#server). **Level 1** Violations can be received on both servers, however **Level 2** and **Level 3** Violations can only be issued on the Expert Server. Each server has its own set of rules and minimum [grade](/guide/getting-started/home-screen/user-profile) requirements, but the Expert Server is for serious users only. If the server rules and procedures are not followed, ATC will strictly enforce this and pilots could be issued a Violation. 

 

**Level 1** Violations are automatically generated if a pilot violates any one of the set conditions. These are outlined below:

 


| Rule                       | Conditions for Violation                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Ground Overspeed           | Above 35kts GS (ground speed) on ground, excluding runways   |
| Flight Overspeed           | Above 250kts IAS (indicated airspeed) below 10,000ft / exceeding max speed warning (VMO/MMO) - does not apply to military aircraft |
| Aerobatics within Airspace | Aerobatics below 5,000ft and within 5 nautical miles of an airport |
| Runway Idle                | Sit idle on a runway longer than 60 seconds without ATC clearance |



## What happens if I get a Violation?

 

To ensure that all pilots get an enjoyable experience (and realistic experience in the case of the Expert Server), Violations are recorded and have the following implications on a pilot:



Level 1 Violation

: If you receive 3 or more Level 1 Violations in one flight, you will automatically be removed from the server and will have to start a flight again.



Level 2 Violation (Amber)

: The pilot is disconnected from the server but can continue the flight offline. The pilot may return to the Expert Server immediately by starting a new flight provided the amount of Level 2 and 3 Violations remain under the server allowed limits.

 

*Insert Picture of Level 2 Violation Report labelled 1 – 4*

 

*1 – Reason*

*2 – User Guide*

*3 – End Flight*

*4 – Continue Offline*

 

1. A reason will always be provided when you receive a Violation, although sometimes the information provided in the app can be limited. You can contact the controller on the forum at [community.infiniteflight.com](https://community.infiniteflight.com/) if you wish to find out further information or to appeal the Violation

 

2. The User Guide button will end your current flight and take you direct to our guides where you can find more information

 

3. The End Flight button will end your flight, provide a summary of your flight and then take you back to the Fly Online Screen

 

4. You also have the option to Continue Offline but you will be invisible to other players and will no longer be able to see ATC or traffic



Level 3 Violation (Red)

: The pilot is disconnected from the server but can continue the flight offline. The pilot will not be able to return to the Expert Server after the flight has been ended, with access being restricted for 7 days following this.

In addition, Violations are kept on a pilot’s record and therefore, if a pilot continues to receive Violations (**Level 2** and **Level 3** only), Expert Server access will be restricted for longer. Currently no more than 5 **Level 2** and/or **Level 3** Violations can be received within a 365 day rolling period for access to the server.

 

## How to prevent Violations

 

The best way to prevent Violations is to:

 

* Familiarize yourself with the Official Tutorials and guides provided at [infiniteflight.com](/guide)

* Join our community at [community.infiniteflight.com](https://community.infiniteflight.com/) and ask questions, there are loads of pilots & controllers out there ready to lend a hand

* Once your grade is high enough to join the Expert Server, take it slow, follow all ATC instructions and be courteous to other pilots

 

If you do still find that you receive violations try to find out why, and learn from the experience.

 

## Appealing a Level 2 or 3 Violation

 

We recommend that you only appeal **Level 3** Violations as these prevent access to the Expert Server, whereas **Level 2** Violations allow you to start a new flight (provided you have not exceeded the total amount of Violations allowed). However, if you believe a Violation was issued in error, you can appeal at any time by following the steps below:

 

Step 1

: Access your [User Profile](/guide/getting-started/home-screen/user-profile) and tap on the information link by your Grade

 

Step 2

: Tap the Violation History Log, this will show all Violations, and specifically the controller’s name associated with the Violation you wish to appeal

 

Step 3

: Visit [community.infiniteflight.com](https://community.infiniteflight.com/) and send a private message to the controller with your callsign, date of Violation and as much detail as you can provide about the event. If you cannot find the controller or if you are a new user, you can send the appeal to @reports instead

 

Step 4

: If 7 days has elapsed since the Violation, you may be asked by the controller to provide your [pilot replay](/guide/getting-started/home-screen/replays#pilot-replays) as evidence

 

Step 5

: Be patient and we will endeavor to assist you through the process
