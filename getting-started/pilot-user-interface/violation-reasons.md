# Violation Reasons



Below is a complete list of all the reasons that can be used by Controllers when issuing a Pilot with a [Violation](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/violations). Not sure what Violations are? A brief summary is below but more information can be found on our dedicated [Violation](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/violations) page:



Level 1 Violation

: If a pilot receives 3 or more Level 1 Violations in one flight, they will automatically be removed from the server and will have to start a flight again.



Level 2 Violation (Amber)

: The pilot is disconnected from the server but can continue the flight offline. The pilot may return to the Expert Server immediately by starting a new flight provided the number of Level 2 and 3 Violations remain under the server allowed limits.



Level 3 Violation (Red)

: The pilot is disconnected from the server but can continue the flight offline. The pilot will not be able to return to the Expert Server after the flight has been ended, with access being restricted for 7 days following this.



Tip

: This page should help you identify the reason why you received a violation, however they are sometimes generic and the specific circumstances to your situation may not be listed. Still not sure, why not try and [contact the controller directly](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/violations#appealing-a-level-2-or-3-violation) on our Community Forum?



## Not Following Instructions

*Issued by: Ground/Tower*/Radar

*Violation Level: 2*



Whilst on the Expert Server it is important to follow all ATC instructions - this includes the ATIS, any TFRs, assigned headings/altitudes and speeds, diversion commands, go-around instructions or approach clearances.



Taking-Off/Landing without permission, following your flight plan instead of ATC instructions or remaining unresponsive during critical phases of flight (i.e. climbing, descending or manuevering) can result in being removed from the server.



## Unable to Communicate â€“ Contact moderator

*Issued by: Ground/Tower/Radar*

*Violation Level: 2*



The Controller was unable to communicate with you and therefore removed you from the Server to prevent a degradation in service to other pilots. Please contact the Moderating Team using the link below for this to be removed from your record:

## Failure to Exit the Runway

*Issued by: Tower*

*Violation Level: 2*



Ground awarness is an essential part of any flight, therefore you must ensure that you have clearance to taxi or cross/enter runways (if ATC is active), and under all circumstances, check it is clear. Do not taxi through grass or terminal areas, block active taxiways or get too close to other aircraft.

## Spamming Frequency - Unecessary Duplicate Requests

*Issued by: Ground/Tower/Radar*

*Violation Level: 2*



The Expert Server can be incredibly busy, Controllers will always try to give the best and most expeditious service possible, however; there may be occasions where patience is required. This is particularly important during events, peak times and/or at the most popular airports. Therefore, Pilots must avoid sending duplicate requests when possible as this may be treated as spamming the frequency.



## Inappropriate Callsign

*Issued by: Ground/Tower/Radar*

*Violation Level: 3*



Inappropriate callsigns are not tolerated on the Expert Server - pilots can expect to be removed from the server.
