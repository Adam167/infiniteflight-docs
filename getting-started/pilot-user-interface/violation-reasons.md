## Not Following Instructions

Whilst on the Expert Server it is important to follow all ATC instructions - this includes the ATIS, any TFRs, assigned headings/altitudes and speeds, diversion commands, go-around instructions or approach clearances.



Taking-Off/Landing without permission, following your flight plan instead of ATC instructions or remaining unresponsive during critical phases of flight (i.e. climbing, descending or manuevering) can result in being removed from the server.



- Failure to follow ATIS
- Failure to follow TFR
- Unresponsive whilst Climbing, Descending or Manuevering 
- Take-Off / Land without Permission
- Failure to Divert
- Not following ATC assigned Heading, Altitude, or Speed
- Following Flight Plan instead of ATC Instruction
- Failure to complete Instrument Approach
- Failure to Go-Around
- Failure to execute Missed Approach

## Unable to Communicate – Contact Moderator

The Controller was unable to communicate with you and therefore removed you from the Server to prevent a degradation in service to other pilots. Please contact the Moderating Team using the link below for this to be removed from your record:

## Inappropriate Behaviour

The Expert Server can be incredibly busy, Controllers will always try to give the best and most expeditious service possible, however; there may be occasions where patience is required. This is particularly important during events, peak times and/or at the most popular airports. Therefore, Pilots must avoid sending duplicate requests when possible as this may be treated as spamming the frequency.



In addition, inappropriate callsigns, taking-off/landing from grass, ramp areas and/or taxiways, and flying through other aircraft; are not tolerated on the Expert Server - pilots can expect to be removed from the server.



- Spamming Frequency - Unnecessary Duplicate Requests
- Inappropriate Callsign
- Take-Off/Landing from Grass, Ramp, or Taxiway
- Flying through other Aircraft



## Ground Awareness

Ground awarness is an essential part of any flight, therefore you must ensure that you have clearance to taxi or cross/enter runways (if ATC is active), and under all circumstances, check it is clear. Do not taxi through grass or terminal areas, block active taxiways or get too close to other aircraft.



- Entered a Runway without Permission
- Taxi without Permission
- Taxiing through Others
- Taxiing through Grass or Terminal Area
- Failure to Give Way
- Too Close to the Aircraft Ahead
- Blocking an Active Taxiway
- Crossing the Hold Line without Permission
- Failure to Exit Runway

## Airmanship

Situational awareness whilst flying is an important aspect that pilots must maintain to enjoy a realistic expereince on the Expert Server. Not maintaining appropriate separation with other aircraft, not following sequencing, excessive speed, incorrect arrival procedures, alignment with or landing/departing from the wrong runway; can all result in removal from the Expert Server.



- Failure to follow Sequence
- Failure to maintain appropriate Aircraft Separation
- Excessive Speed in an Airport Environment 
- Incorrect Arrival Procedures - Innapropriate Altitude, Speed, Position
- Aligned with the Wrong Runway
- Landing/Departing on the Wrong Runway
