Let&#39;s get you ready to fly! Welcome to the screen you&#39;ll see once you&#39;ve [calibrated your device](/guide/manual/pilot-user-interface/calibration). Below is a breakdown of everything on the screen:



1. This is the Head Up Display (HUD) and shows all the major information such as speed, altitude and aircraft attitude. Want more info? [See Pilot User Interface – Head Up Display (HUD).](/guide/manual/pilot-user-interface/hud)

   

2. The mini map is a great tool to be able to see your surroundings without leaving the main screen to check your flight plan. Want more info? See [Pilot User Interface – Mini Map](/guide/manual/pilot-user-interface/mini-map).

   

3. If you&#39;re on one of the live servers, you&#39;ll be able to talk to the Air Traffic Controllers using this button. Want more info? See [Pilot User Interface – Communication](/guide/manual/pilot-user-interface/communication).

   

4. The mini map can be used to make a flight plan, but if you want more detail and a view of the whole earth, you can check this out too. Want more info? See [Pilot User Interface – Flight Plan](/guide/manual/pilot-user-interface/flight-plan).

   

5. The status bar at the bottom of the screen can provide loads of information which is fully customizable so that you can choose what you want to see. Want more info? See [Pilot User Interface – Status Bar](/guide/manual/pilot-user-interface/status-bar).
