# Flight Planning



## Map

![Flight Plan Screen](_images/manual/frames/flight-plan-screen.jpg)



1. The Flight Plan (FPL) section shows your next waypoint (WPT), desired track (DTK), distance (DIST) and the estimated time en-route (ETE). The active waypoint is always displayed in magenta.

   

2. The buttons at the bottom of the FPL page have the following functions:

   | Button        | Function                               |
   | ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
   | -             | Delete a waypoint                      |
   | Act. Leg      | Make a waypoint the active leg         |
   | Clear         | Clear entire flight plan               |
   | Up/Down Arrow | Move a waypoint up/down in flight plan |



3. The search function can be used to find any airport or waypoint in the database as well as any latitude/longitude coordinate. 

   

   Tip

   : If you already have a route you want to fly, paste the route into the search function and it will automatically be populated into you Flight Plan.

   

4. You can tap any fix/airport/navigation aid on the map and add this to your Flight Plan using the &#39;+&#39; symbol. If you tap the symbol next to this, it will perform a &#39;direct to&#39; function and wipe all of your flight plan and go directly to the waypoint selected.

   

5. In the bottom right of the screen is settings, center screen and zoom in/out functions. Additionally, you can cycle the display between just the Map, Flight Plan, or both displayed.



 *Insert 'map 1' screenshot (labelled 1-5)*



*1 – Airport (PHKO)*

*2 – VOR (UPP located at the north of the island)*

*3 – ADF (NDB BSF located just left of PHSF)*

*4 – Fix (VINIE located southeast of PHSF)*

*5 – Settings, Centre-screen function, zoom in/out and MAP/FPL toggle function*

 

1. Airports are always represented by either blue or magenta dots, if you’re flying online they may also have a colored dot in the middle for reference to the weather. See ["Home User Interface – Fly Online – Airport and Gate Selection"](/guide/getting-started/home-user-interface/fly-online#airport-and-gate-selection) for more info.

   

2. VOR (Very High Frequency [VHF] Omnidirectional Range) navigation aids are represented by this symbol. They can be tuned to either NAV 1 or 2, if fitted on your selected aircraft.

   

3. NDB (Non Directional Beacon) navigation aids are represented by this symbol. They can be tuned to ADF 1 (Automatic Direction Finder), if fitted on your selected aircraft.

   

4. A GPS (Global Positioning System) Fix is represented by this symbol.

   

5. In the bottom right of the screen is settings, center screen and zoom in/out functions. Additionally, you can cycle the display between just the Map, Flight Plan, or both displayed

   

## Mini Map

![Mini Map](_images/manual/frames/mini-map.jpg)



1. The mini map is a great tool to be able to see where other aircraft are, to view your flight plan, and to discover your surroundings whilst you fly – just scroll your finger around the map to explore. 

   

2. Customizable settings, the zoom in/out function and a center screen button are available on the mini map by just tapping it.



## Getting more from your Map and Mini Map

 

*Insert ‘video clip' showing tapping close to PHKO, selecting PHKO from the list and then cycling between ‘info’, ‘weather’, ‘runways’ and 'procedures'*



Step 1

: By tapping close to an airport, navigation aid or fix, a drop down list will appear on the map

 

Step 2

: You can select which one you want from the list for more info, tap the ‘+’ symbol to add it to your Flight Plan, or the symbol next to this to perform a ‘direct to’ function

 

Step 3

: The information tab is always displayed initially; but the weather, runway and procedure tabs can be displayed by tapping on them



## Selecting Departure, Arrival and Approach Procedures

 

*Insert 'video clip' showing opening the 'procedures' menu, selecting an arrival & transition and then approach & transition.*



Step 1

: Open the procedures tab by following the step by step guide in "Getting more from your Map and Mini Map"



Step 2

: You have the option to select Approach (what approach you want to fly), Arrival (the STAR) or Departure (the SID)



Step 3

: Selecting Approach will give you a list of approaches for the different runways at your selected airport and  a preview will display on the map as you cycle through them. Tap 'select' at the bottom when you have your desired approach



Tip

: Make sure to select one of the approaches that has been broadcast as in use on the ATIS (if ATC are present); or if uncontrolled, the approach that favors the weather and current traffic levels



Step 4

: Some approaches may give you a further option called Transitions. These usually start the approach from a navigation aid such as a VOR, but if you would prefer, you can just select 'Vectors to Final' and the transition will not be included. 



Step 5

: Once you're happy with your selection you can tap 'Add to Flight Plan'. The 'Back' button is available if you change your mind



Step 6

: You can now select an arrival and departure using the same technique as above
