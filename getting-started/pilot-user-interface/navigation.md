# Navigation



## Map

*Insert ‘Image 2.1 screenshot (labelled 1 – 5)*

 

*1 – Airport (PHKO)*

*2 – VOR (UPP located at the north of the island)*

*3 – ADF (NDB BSF located just left of PHSF)*

*4 – Fix (VINIE located southeast of PHSF)*

*5 – Settings, Centre-screen function, zoom in/out and MAP/FPL toggle function*

 

1. Airports are always represented by either blue or magenta dots, if you’re flying online they may also have a colored dot in the middle for reference to the weather. See "Home User Interface – Fly Online – Airport and Gate Selection" for more info.

   

2. VOR (Very High Frequency [VHF] Omnidirectional Range) navigation aids are represented by this symbol. They can be tuned to either NAV 1 or 2, if fitted on your selected aircraft.

   

3. NDB (Non Directional Beacon) navigation aids are represented by this symbol. They can be tuned to ADF 1 (Automatic Direction Finder), if fitted on your selected aircraft.

   

4. A GPS (Global Positioning System) Fix is represented by this symbol.

   

5. In the bottom right of the screen is settings, center screen and zoom in/out functions. Additionally, you can cycle the display between just the Map, Flight Plan, or both displayed

   

## Mini Map

![Mini Map](_images/manual/frames/mini-map.jpg)



1. The mini map is a great tool to be able to see where other aircraft are, to view your flight plan, and to discover your surroundings whilst you fly – just scroll your finger around the map to explore. 

   

2. Customizable settings, the zoom in/out function and a center screen button are available on the mini map by just tapping it.



## Getting more from your Map and Mini Map

 

*Insert ‘video showing tapping close to PHKO, selecting PHKO from the list and then cycling between ‘info’, ‘weather’, ‘runways’ and 'procedures'*



Step 1

: By tapping close to an airport, navigation aid or fix, a drop down list will appear on the map

 

Step 2

: You can select which one you want from the list for more info, tap the ‘+’ symbol to add it to your Flight Plan, or the symbol next to this to perform a ‘direct to’ function

 

Step 3

: The information tab is always displayed initially; but the weather, runway and procedure tabs can be displayed by tapping on them



## Selecting Departure, Arrival and Approach Procedures

 

*Insert video showing opening the 'procedures' menu, selecting an arrival & transition and then approach & transition.*



Step 1

: Open the procedures tab by following the step by step guide in "Getting more from your Map and Mini Map"



Step 2

: You have the option to select Approach (what approach you want to fly), Arrival (the STAR) or Departure (the SID)



Step 3

: Selecting Approach will give you a list of approaches for the different runways at your selected airport and  a preview will display on the map as you cycle through them. Tap 'select' at the bottom when you have your desired approach



Tip

: Make sure to select one of the approaches that has been broadcast as in use on the ATIS (if ATC are present); or if uncontrolled, the approach that favors the weather and current traffic levels



Step 4

: Some approaches may give you a further option called Transitions. These usually start the approach from a navigation aid such as a VOR, but if you would prefer, you can just select 'Vectors to Final' and the transition will not be included. 



Step 5

: Once you're happy with your selection you can tap 'Add to Flight Plan'. The 'Back' button is available if you change your mind



Step 6

: You can now select an arrival and departure using the same technique as above



## Tuning to an ILS

 

*Insert ‘video of tuning ILS at PHKO*



Step 1

: Select the airport you want using the technique shown in "Getting more from your Map and Mini Map"

 

Step 2

: Cycle to the Runway tab

 

Step 3

: Tap the runway you want to tune to, it must have an ILS (Instrument Landing System)

 

Step 4

: Tap ‘Set NAV 1’ (you need to be within 25 miles to do this). NAV 1 will display in green by the runway to show it has been tuned successfully

 

## Displaying an ILS in your Aircraft



*Insert ‘video of displaying ILS at PHKO in aircraft’*



Step 1

: Once you have tuned the ILS to NAV 1, tap ‘NAV’ on the Fly Screen

 

Step 2

: The Avionics tab will appear, NAV 1 will have the ILS frequency and ident displayed and beneath this, CRS (course) 1 will show the runway course. Make sure ‘SOURCE’ is set to ‘NAV 1’ to use it in the aircraft

 

Step 3

: The Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI) will display the Localizer (lateral) deviation scale and the Altitude tape will now show the Glideslope (vertical) deviation scale

 

Step 4

: The course for the lateral deviation scale can be adjusted using CRS 1, this can be used to fly a Back Course Localizer

 

## Tuning to a VOR or ADF



*Insert ‘video of tuning VOR UPP*



Step 1



: Select the VOR or NDB you want using the technique shown in ‘Getting more from your Map and Mini Map’

 

Step 2



: For VOR’s tap ‘Set NAV 1’ or ‘Set NAV 2’. ‘Tuned to NAV 1 (or 2)’ will display beneath the VOR info. For NDB’s tap ‘Set ADF 1’ and similarly, ‘Tuned to ADF 1’ will be shown

 

## Displaying a VOR in your Aircraft

 

*Insert ‘video of displaying VOR UPP in aircraft’*

 

Step 1

: Once you have tuned the VOR to either NAV 1 or 2, tap ‘NAV’ on the Fly Screen

 

Step 2

: The Avionics tab will appear, NAV 1 or 2 will have the VOR frequency and ident displayed. BRG (bearing) 1 or 2 can be changed to ‘NAV 1 (or 2)’ and the selected needle will display this information on the Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI)

 

Step 3

: CRS (course) 1 or 2 will have 360 set by default but any radial can be selected. Provided ‘SOURCE’ is set to ‘NAV 1 (or 2)’, the HSI will display the lateral deviation scale, and the course can be adjusted to intercept and fly different radials to/from the VOR beacon

 

## Displaying an ADF in your Aircraft

 

*Insert ‘video of displaying NDB BSF in aircraft’*



Step 1

: Once you have tuned the NDB to ADF 1, tap ‘NAV’ on the Fly Screen

 

Step 2

: The Avionics tab will appear, ADF 1 will have the NDB frequency and ident displayed. BRG (bearing) 1 or 2 can be changed to ‘ADF’ and the selected needle will display this information on the Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI)

 

## Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS)

 

**Insert ‘Image 2.2 screenshot\* (labelled 1 – 4)*

 

*1 – White Aircraft*

*2 – Blue Aircraft*

*3 – Amber Aircraft*

*4 – Red Aircraft*



1. On both the Map and Mini Map, your aircraft is displayed with a white aircraft symbol. These symbols vary in size dependent on what aircraft you are flying

   

2. Blue aircraft show other aircraft

   

3. Aircraft will turn **Amber**{.amber} as a Warning if the following conditions are met:

   

   \-    Both aircraft are airborne with a speed above 40kts

   \-    The altitude difference is less than 2000ft

   \-    The other aircraft is within 40 seconds at current speed

   

4. Aircraft will turn **Red**{.red} as an Alert if the following conditions are met:

   

   \-    All conditions for an Amber warning are met

   \-    The altitude difference is less than 600ft

   

**Manual pilot intervention is required if a TCAS Alert** **(** **red**{.red} **)** **is generated, below is a table to help you know what to do:**

 

*Insert TCAS symbols from map into the example section of the table*

 

| **Example** | **Meaning**                      | **Pilot  Actions**                                           |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Blue +30    | The aircraft is 3000ft above you | No action required                                           |
| Amber +10   | The aircraft is 1000ft above you | Air Traffic Controllers will ensure 3 miles  lateral or 1000ft vertical separation at all times. No action required |
| Amber -8    | The aircraft is 800ft below you  | Aircraft separation is close to being broken  - if under active ATC, request deviation if no instructions given |
| Red -1      | The aircraft is 100ft below you  | With or without active ATC – smoothly adjust  your flight path to avoid the aircraft, if they are below you we recommend  climbing, if they are above, we recommend descending |

 

Tip

: The minimum aircraft separation that you must maintain at all times is 3nm of each other laterally, or 1000ft vertically. When under active ATC they will ensure this separation is maintained. In busy airspace it is common to see lots of Amber aircraft - don’t overreact, just keep a good eye on your mini map whilst flying!

 

## Communication using the Map and Mini Map

 

*Insert ‘video of selecting active freq at airport*



Step 1

: Select the airport you want using the technique shown in "Getting more from your Map"

 

Step 2

: The info tab will show all active frequencies, the one you are currently tuned to will be highlighted green and labelled ‘COM 1’

 

Step 3

: Tap ‘TUNE’ next to any frequency to make it COM 1 (you must be within range of an airport to tune to its frequencies and you can only tune to radar frequencies when airborne
