1. By tapping on the Autopilot (AP) symbol, the autopilot box will appear displaying the Flight Control Unit (FCU) options.



Step 1

: To engage the autopilot, tap the &#39;AP OFF&#39; button (you must be airborne for the autopilot functions to work correctly). The button will be highlighted by an orange hollow box and will change to &#39;AP ON'

Step 2

: Basic modes will automatically engage, these are current heading and vertical speed (VS)

Step 3

: Altitude (ALT), vertical speed (VS), speed (SPD), heading (HDG), vertical navigation (VNAV), lateral navigation (LNAV) and approach mode (APPR) can be engaged or disengaged by tapping each symbol. By pressing and holding on each symbol (with the exception of the AP, VNAV, LNAV and APPR), and then moving your finger up or down, the value can be changed

Step 4

: The altitude and heading selections have turquoise bugs which appear on the HUD. These values can be pre-set before engagement of the Autopilot. Want more info? See [Pilot User Interface - HUD](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-plan).
