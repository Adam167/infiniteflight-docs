# Communication

![Communication](_images/manual/frames/communication.jpg)



1. The top left corner of the communication box shows the current frequency that you are tuned to, the Air Traffic Controller details (if it is an active frequency) and the METAR.

   

2. The top right corner of the communication box contains a reminder of the last altitude, heading, speed and runway assignments issued by a radar controlled frequency, make sure to follow them!

   

3. The boxes will automatically populate as you come into range with active frequencies (represented by a green text) or Unicom (uncontrolled) frequencies. Simply tap the frequency you want to tune to. You can also tune out of a frequency.

   

   Tip

   : If you&#39;re tuned to an active frequency, make sure you have permission before changing frequency!

   

4. All communication is logged here, double tap the area to only show communication made by you and controllers talking to you.

   

5. As well as the communication box, when messages are sent or received by ATC, they will appear for a short time at the top of the screen. If a message is sent to you by the controller, it will appear in orange and the communication symbol in the bottom left of the screen will flash as a prompt for you to open the box and reply.

Step 2

: The info tab will show all active frequencies, the one you are currently tuned to will be highlighted green and labelled ‘COM 1’

 

Step 3

: Tap ‘TUNE’ next to any frequency to make it COM 1 (you must be within range of an airport to tune to its frequencies and you can only tune to radar frequencies when airborne
