# Reports and Violations

​               

## What are Reports and Violations?

 

There are various live servers **(Insert hyperlink to ‘Home Screen User Interface – Fly Online – Server’)** available to use, each server has its own set of rules and minimum grade **(Insert hyperlink to ‘Home Screen User Interface – User Profile’)** requirements. The Expert Server is for serious users only, and this is strictly enforced by ATC through the use of a reporting system. Reports can be categorized as either **Major** or **Minor** and will be issued to pilots if realistic rules and procedures are not followed

 

Violations are automatically generated if a pilot violates any one of the set conditions. These are only generated on the Training & Expert Servers and are outlined below:

## What happens if I get a Report or Violation?

 

To ensure that all pilots get an enjoyable experience (and realistic experience in the case of the Expert Server), Reports & Violations are recorded and have the following implications on a pilot:

 

Major Report (Red)

: The pilot is made invisible for the current session and Expert Server access is restricted for 7 days following this.

*1 – Reason*

*2 – User Guide*

*3 – End Flight*

*4 – Continue Offline*

 

1. A reason will always be provided when you receive a report, although sometimes the information provided in the app can be limited. You can contact the controller on the forum at community.infiniteflight.com **(insert hyperlink)** if you wish to find out further information or to appeal the report

 

2. The User Guide button will end your current flight and take you direct to our guides where you can find more information

 

3. The End Flight button will end your flight, provide a summary of your flight and then take you back to the Fly Online Screen

 

4. You also have the option to Continue Offline but you will be invisible to other players and will no longer be able to see ATC or traffic

 

Minor Report (Amber)

: The pilot is made invisible for the current session but may return to the Expert Server immediately by starting a new flight.

In addition, Reports are kept on a pilot’s record and therefore, if a pilot continues to get reported, Expert Server access will be restricted for longer. Currently no more than 5 reports (**Major** or **Minor**) can be received within a 365 day rolling period for access to the server.

 

Violations do not affect your access to a server, however if you receive 5 or more violations in one flight, you will automatically be removed from the server and will have to start a flight again.

 

## How to prevent Reports and Violations

 

The best way to prevent Reports and Violations is to:

 

* Familiarize yourself with the Official Tutorials and guides provided at infiniteflight.com **(insert hyperlink)**

* Join our community at community.infiniteflight.com **(insert hyperlink)** and ask questions, there are loads of pilots & controllers out there ready to lend a hand

* Once your grade is high enough to join the Expert Server, take it slow, follow all ATC instructions and be courteous to other pilots

 

If you do still find that you are reported or receive violations try to find out why, and learn from the experience.

 

## Appealing a Report

 

We recommend that you only appeal **Major** reports as these prevent access to the Expert Server, whereas **Minor** Reports allow you to start a new flight (provided you have not exceeded the total amount of reports allowed). However, if you believe a report was issued in error, you can appeal at any time by following the steps below:

 

Step 1

: Access your User Profile **(Insert hyperlink to ‘Home Screen User Interface – User Profile’)** and tap on the information link by your Grade

 

Step 2

: Tap the Flight Penalty Log, this will show all Reports and Violations, and specifically the controller’s name

 

Step 3

: Visit community.infiniteflight.com **(insert hyperlink)** and send a private message to the controller with your callsign, date of report and as much detail as you can provide about the event. If you cannot find the controller or if you are a new user, you can send the appeal to @reports instead

 

Step 4

: If 7 days has elapsed since the report, you may be asked by the controller to provide your pilot replay **(Insert hyperlink to ‘Home Screen User Interface – Replays’)** as evidence

 

Step 5

: Be patient and we will endeavour to assist you through the process
