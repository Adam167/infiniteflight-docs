# Head Up Display (HUD)

![Head Up Display](_images/manual/frames/hud.jpg)



1. The Outside Air Temperature (OAT) is shown here in Celsius.

   

2. The speed tape shows the aircraft speed. Dependent on what aircraft you are flying, it may also show colors to signify flying too slow/fast (red) or at the correct speed (green).

   

3. Groundspeed (GS), Mach Number (M) and wind direction/speed are displayed here.

   

4. The Attitude Indicator displays the aircrafts attitude in relation to the horizon, and also provides a Flight Path Vector (a green circle enabled in the [Systems menu](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/systems#systems)).

   

5. The altitude tape shows the aircraft altitude, current vertical speed is displayed at the bottom of the tap and a turquoise bug represents the altitude that is selected on the aircraft Flight Control Unit (FCU) within the [Autopilot](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/autopilot#autopilot).

   

6. The power is displayed as a percentage, and the equivalent N1 (if applicable to the aircraft type) is displayed at the top of this.

   

7. The Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI) is displayed here and is used for [Navigation](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/navigation#navigation). There is a turquoise bug just like the altitude tape, which displays the selected heading on the aircraft FCU.
