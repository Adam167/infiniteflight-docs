# Flight Plan Screen

![Flight Plan Screen](_images/manual/frames/flight-plan-screen.jpg)



1. The Flight Plan (FPL) section shows your next waypoint (WPT), desired track (DTK), distance (DIST) and the estimated time en-route (ETE). The active waypoint is always displayed in magenta.

   

2. The buttons at the bottom of the FPL page have the following functions:

   | Button        | Function                               |
   | ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
   | -             | Delete a waypoint                      |
   | Act. Leg      | Make a waypoint the active leg         |
   | Clear         | Clear entire flight plan               |
   | Up/Down Arrow | Move a waypoint up/down in flight plan |



3. The search function can be used to find any airport or waypoint in the database as well as any latitude/longitude coordinate. 

   

   Tip

   : If you already have a route you want to fly, paste the route into the search function and it will automatically be populated into you Flight Plan.

   

4. You can tap any fix/airport/navigation aid on the map and add this to your Flight Plan using the &#39;+&#39; symbol. If you tap the symbol next to this, it will perform a &#39;direct to&#39; function and wipe all of your flight plan and go directly to the waypoint selected.

   

5. In the bottom right of the screen is settings, center screen and zoom in/out functions. Additionally, you can cycle the display between just the Map, Flight Plan, or both displayed.
