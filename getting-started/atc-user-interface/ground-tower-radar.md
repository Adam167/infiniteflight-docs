# Ground, Tower & Radar

Ground, Tower & Radar frequencies all share an interface in common, with each mode offering different commands depending on the situation of the pilot.



## Aircraft Not On Frequency

1. The Status page, the view from the control tower, and all frequencies currently open by the user are displayed with tabs on the left of the screen. Any tab can be selected by just tapping on it

   

2. The current weather is displayed here

   

3. The current time (UTC) as well as time elapsed controlling is displayed here. By tapping on the elapsed time, controllers can set multiple timers which can be reset and used whilst controlling

   

4. An aircraft that is not on frequency is displayed in grey, and by tapping on the aircraft various options are given



## Aircraft On Frequency

1. An aircraft that is on frequency is displayed in blue, and by tapping on the aircraft various options are given

   

2. Each aircraft that is on frequency will have a strip displayed that will have basic information populated

   

3. When "other message" or the aircraft strip are tapped, a menu will appear to allow the controller to send messages to the aircraft



## Message Menu

3. When an aircraft sends a message to the controller, the aircraft strip and aircraft will flash amber provided the controller has that frequency displayed

   

4. The message sent will also populate the message box in the bottom right hand corner of the screen. This message box will show all messages between all aircraft

   

5. Customizable settings, the zoom in/out function and a center screen button are always available here

1. The aircraft tag cycles between callsign and aircraft type. The aircraftâ€™s altitude and groundspeed is always displayed beneath this. If the aircraft is receiving an ATC service to an Airport, then the service, airport code, and runway (if applicable), will be displayed as well



## Drag & Vector Tool

1. The drag and vector tool can be used on any radar frequency (e.g. approach and departure) by pressing, holding and then dragging from the aircraft towards the direction you want to vector the aircraft in. As you drag, information is displayed that shows the heading, distance, time it will take to reach the point of drag (at the aircrafts current speed) and the surrounding terrain. When you release, options to send the message to the aircraft will be displayed
