1. The Airspace Status table shows all airports that are currently being controlled, how many arrivals are inbound, and specifically which frequencies are open at each airport (displayed using a green person symbol).

   

2. Below this is the Incoming Airplanes table which provides more detailed information on the arrivals to the airport that you are controlling.
