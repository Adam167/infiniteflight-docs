1. The mini map is a great tool to be able to see where other aircraft are, to view your flight plan, and to discover your surroundings whilst you fly â€“ just scroll your finger around the map to explore. Want more info? See [Pilot User Interface - Flight Plan](/docs/manual/pilot-user-interface/flight-plan).

   

2. Customisable settings, the zoom in/out function and a centre screen button are always available on the mini map by just tapping it.
