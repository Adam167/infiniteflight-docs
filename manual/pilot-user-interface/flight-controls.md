# Flight Controls

![Flight Controls](_images/manual/frames/flight-controls.png)



1. All aircraft variants have a parking brake and trim; and some will have a retractable landing gear, flaps and spoilers too. 

   The gear and park brake can be cycled up/down and on/off respectively by just tapping the symbol (the gear can only be retracted whilst airborne). 

   Spoilers, Trim and Flaps can be changed by pressing and holding on the symbol, and then sliding your finger to the desired position.

   

2. The rudder is controlled with the RUD BRAKES symbol in the bottom right of the screen. Press and hold the symbol, and then move it left or right to move the rudder in the same direction.

   In addition, the rudder offers differential braking to the undercarriage. To do this, press and hold the symbol, and drag your finger towards the bottom of the screen, a percentage will show indicating the level of braking being achieved.
