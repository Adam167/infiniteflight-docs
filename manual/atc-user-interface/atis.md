# ATIS

1. The Meteorological Terminal Air Report (more commonly known as a **METAR**), is the current weather at the airport and usually displays date/time recorded, wind direction and strength, visibility, weather and cloud, temperature and dew point, and finally pressure.

   

2. The available runways can be selected from this tab, and will use the red/amber/green colour code.

   | Indication                                                 | Meaning                                      |
   | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
   | ![Green Runway](_images/manual/tables/weather-green.png)   | Headwind under 3kts - runway recommended     |
   | ![Orange Runway](_images/manual/tables/weather-orange.png) | Crosswind above 3kts                         |
   | ![Red Runway](_images/manual/tables/weather-red.png)       | Tailwind above 3kts - runway not recommended |

3. **REMARKS** can be added to the ATIS to provide pilots with more information such as &#39;No Pattern Work allowed&#39;.

   

4. **NOTAMS** are used in the same way as REMARKS above, and provide more information for pilots.

   

5. When multiple frequencies are in use, the ATIS can be used to tell pilots which frequency to contact from what direction.

   

6. Once you have finished selecting the runways, remarks, NOTAMS and frequencies that you wish to use, you can check what the final message will look like to make sure it is correct.

   

7. When ready to publish, select the ATIS information (i.e. Alpha, Bravo, Charlie etc) and then hit **PUBLISH**. 

   

   TIP

   : Don&#39;t forget to keep your ATIS up to date! When the weather, runways/frequencies in use, remarks or NOTAMS change, update your ATIS and publish with the next letter of the phonetic alphabet.
