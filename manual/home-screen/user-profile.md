# User Profile



![User Profile Page](_images/manual/frames/user-profile.png)

​           

Your User Profile is a way of keeping track whilst you’re flying or controlling the skies of Infinite Flight. Below is everything you need to know about what it records!

 

1. Your Display Name can be changed here and is shown on a display tag when you’re online. To help users identify you, we recommend using a similar Display Name to your Infinite Flight Community Username. Not a member of the IFC yet? [Join here!](https://community.infiniteflight.com/)

   

2. Your Callsign can be changed here and is what you’ll be called by Air Traffic Controllers that are communicating with you. You can choose between Airline callsigns or your own General Aviation callsigns, and you can add various Suffixes to these too.

   

3.  XP is displayed here and is automatically updated as your flight progresses. Stats that contribute to this are flight time, the number of landings (taking into account g-force), the wind & turbulence during the landing, and any violations received.

   

4. Flight Time is displayed here from all flights that are completed online.  

   

   Tip

   : Don’t forget to hit ‘exit flight’ when you’re done, otherwise this data might not get recorded!

 

5. Your Infinite Flight Grade is displayed here. Grades are determined from your total stats, your behaviour whilst online, and your activity. Check out the table below:
