# Air Traffic Control

![ATC Page](_images/manual/frames/atc.png)

1. Pick your frequencies using the [Station Selection button](#station-selection).

   

2. There are various servers for different experiences, select the [Server button](/docs/manual/home-screen/fly-online#server) to pick the best fit for you (note that the Expert Server has restricted access for controlling).

   

3. The Airspace Status table helps show you how many aircraft are inbound to a particular airport and if it has active ATC. You can tap the refresh button to make sure it’s up to date before you decide where to control

4.  Ready to go control? Tap on the Control button to begin!

 

## Station Selection

Selecting frequencies is very similar to selecting an airport and parking position if you were about to fly. The globe is displayed in the same way, and you can either use the features below to choose where to begin, or zoom in with your fingers!

1. The search function allows you to find the airport you want with ease. If you know the ICAO four letter code (e.g. KSFO for San Francisco Intl.) then you can type some or all of this, and a list of options will appear. Alternatively, just type in some or all of the city/airport name. 

   

2. Blue dots signify airports that have a tower facility (although it may not necessarily have active ATC). We also use a variety of colours to give you an idea of what the weather is like. Check out the table below:

    | Indication                                      | Meaning                      |
    | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
    | ![VFR](_images/manual/tables/weather-vfr.png)   | Visual Flight Rules          |
    | ![MVFR](_images/manual/tables/weather-mvfr.png) | Marginal Visual Flight Rules |
    | ![IFR](_images/manual/tables/weather-ifr.png)   | Instrument Flight Rules      |



3. Magenta dots signify uncontrolled airports. The same colours as the blue dots are used to show weather. Check out the table above.

   

4. Zoomed in too much? No problem, just tap ‘Reset Zoom’ if you want to zoom out again.

   

5. Runway colour codes help you know where the wind is coming from and which runways are ‘most likely’ in use. But watch out, sometimes controllers will be using a different runway than you’re expecting, make sure to look out for traffic! Check out the table below:

    | Indication                                                   | Meaning                                      |
    | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
    | ![Green Runway](_images/manual/tables/weather-green.png) | Headwind under 3kts - runway recommended     |
    | ![Orange Runway](_images/manual/tables/weather-orange.png)                                                           | Crosswind above 3kts                         |
    | ![Red Runway](_images/manual/tables/weather-red.png)                                                           | Tailwind above 3kts - runway not recommended |

 

6. You can select one or more frequencies to control, and dependant on the server, controller qualifications might affect what you can control too.

   

7. Red cones signify a runway that has an Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach to that runway threshold. White cones signify a Global Positioning System (GPS) approach.
