If you’re about to fly online, we also use a variety of colours to give you an idea of what the weather is like:

| Indication                                      | Meaning                      |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| ![VFR](_images/manual/tables/weather-vfr.png)   | Visual Flight Rules          |
| ![MVFR](_images/manual/tables/weather-mvfr.png) | Marginal Visual Flight Rules |
| ![IFR](_images/manual/tables/weather-ifr.png)   | Instrument Flight Rules      |



Runway color codes help you know where the wind is coming from and which runways are ‘most likely’ in use. But watch out, sometimes controllers will be using a different runway than you’re expecting, make sure to look out for traffic! Check out the table below:

| Indication                                                   | Meaning                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
