The entire globe is ready for you to explore, you can either use the features below to choose where to begin, or zoom in with your fingers!

 

**1**        The search function allows you to find the airport you want with ease. If you know the ICAO four letter code (e.g. KSFO for San Francisco Intl.) then you can type some or all of this, and a list of options will appear. Alternatively, just type in some or all of the city/airport name. 

 

**2**        Blue dots signify airports that have a tower facility (although it may not necessarily have active ATC). If you’re about to fly online, we also use a variety of colours to give you an idea of what the weather is like. Check out the table below:

 

**Insert ‘weather colour code table’ graphic**

 

**3**        Magenta dots signify uncontrolled airports. If you’re about to fly online, there are different colours showing the weather just like the blue dots. Check out the table above.

 

**4**        Zoomed in too much? No problem, just tap ‘Reset Zoom’ if you want to zoom out again.

 

**5**        Runway colour codes help you know where the wind is coming from and which runways are ‘most likely’ in use. But watch out, sometimes controllers will be using a different runway than you’re expecting, make sure to look out for traffic! Check out the table below:

**6**        In solo mode you can park wherever you want, but in online mode all parking positions are size restricted. If the parking positions are red, you’re too big! TOP TIP: Select the aircraft you want to fly before selecting a parking position, then you’ll be able to see where you can and can’t park.

 

**7**        Once you’ve decided on your spawn point, you’ll be able to see what airport and gate has been selected in the bottom right hand corner.
