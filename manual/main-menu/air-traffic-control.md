Selecting frequencies is very similar to selecting an airport and parking position if you were about to fly. The globe is displayed in the same way, and you can either use the features below to choose where to begin, or zoom in with your fingers!

 

**1**        The search function allows you to find the airport you want with ease. If you know the ICAO four letter code (e.g. KSFO for San Francisco Intl.) then you can type some or all of this, and a list of options will appear. Alternatively, just type in some or all of the city/airport name. 

 

**2**        Blue dots signify airports that have a tower facility (although it may not necessarily have active ATC). We also use a variety of colours to give you an idea of what the weather is like. Check out the table below:

**3**        Magenta dots signify uncontrolled airports. The same colours as the blue dots are used to show weather. Check out the table above.

 

**4**        Zoomed in too much? No problem, just tap ‘Reset Zoom’ if you want to zoom out again.

 

**5**        Runway colour codes help you know where the wind is coming from and which runways are ‘most likely’ in use. But watch out, sometimes controllers will be using a different runway than you’re expecting, make sure to look out for traffic! Check out the table below:

**6**        You can select one or more frequencies to control, and dependant on the server, controller qualifications might affect what you can control too.

 

**7**        Red cones signify a runway that has an Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach to that runway threshold. White cones signify a Global Positioning System (GPS) approach.
